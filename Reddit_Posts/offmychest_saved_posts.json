I work in retail management and this particular company could not be more awful. Last week I finally decided I was fed up. \n\nAfter a grueling 4 interview process over the last week I was just offered a position at a significantly better company for: \n\nA. $25,000 more per year base salary \nB. 30mins closer to my house \nC. In a much safer area\n\nAfter the most challenging year of my life, I can honestly say this is the win I needed to keep me pushing. I hope everyone has a great weekend, thanks for reading.  ",

I also wasn't sure if she lost it due to medical reasons. So if you're losing a lot of weight in a small amount of time that could be the case.  If she had brought up a diet or eating healthy or exercising then I would've come right in and told her how awesome she looked, but she was super quiet about it so that also made me hesitate.",

I never know what\u2019s going on, maybe they have an eating disorder, or are going through chemo, and I don\u2019t want to put my foot in my mouth by praising them for losing weight.\n\nPlus I had a friend who lost a bunch of weight and everyone told her how great she looked and it made her feel like she must have looked awful before. She unfortunately regained the weight later and those comments made her feel like everyone must secretly be thinking she looks terrible.\n\nAll that to say people may have noticed your weight loss but don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to comment. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I did have a coworker who was losing tons of weight and I didn\u2019t say a word. She then mentioned in casual conversation that her doctor had started her on ozempic and she was so happy to be losing weight. I then felt comfortable congratulating her and talking over different clothing styles that might look great on her new frame. So it\u2019s possible that if you open the conversational door that you are doing this safely and are happy with your progress that people will be more comfortable chatting with you about it.\n\nRegardless, congratulations and be proud of what I\u2019m sure was a lot of hard work.

The fun in life doesn't have to end just because you've reached \"adulthood.\" To many people, you are still a child, so let yourself be one! The hard parts of adulthood will eventually grow to be normal for you, but I understand that it's scary now. I know it seems like it's the end of world but it's not. In fact, there's so much out there for you to still experience! There have so many people I've met and absolutely amazing opportunities/experiences I've had as a young adult that I'm grateful for. All of them are things I only got to experience because I'm an adult, because I grew up a bit. I just wanted to tell you that the things that scare you about starting adulthood won't scare you as much once you've actually lived through it a bit. Life can be very, very hard, yes, but I hope you have friends and family that can help you along the way too when you're struggling, when the fear of the future becomes too much. Have hope for yourself. If things aren't how you expected them to be, the good thing about growing up is that you have more power to change things, to make your life how you see fit. But you only have that power if you let yourself embrace that change. \n\nThere's still so much more to life than all your fears for the future. Let yourself explore, make mistakes, party, and do all the things you want to do. That's what this period of your life is for. \n\nSorry for the long reply but this is something I was actually thinking about recently, as I wrote a \"letter to my past self\" a couple weeks ago.",

Pregnancy;\nYou need to make a decision as a single entity.\nSo questions to consider;\nCan you keep this child?\nHow are your finances? Can you support it? How about emotionally? How big is your village? Will you receive help from friends and family? What are your life goals? Will this baby move you towards or away or neither?\n\nAfter you know where you stand and what you want. Then you can consider having a discussion with your boyfriend. But know always where you stand before an argument/negotiation/decision in your life.\n\nPregnancy always always changes the life of the mother more than the father. Do not underestimate it. \n\n2. Cheating:\nWhere do you stand in cheating? What is the context behind it ?\nSome individuals are black and white and don't tolerate any cheating. Others aren't, and sometimes, albeit rarely it can lead to couples therapy and overall relationship improvement.\n\nWhat do you want? That is the most important thing \nIt is your body and your relationship.\n\nHowever, realistically, it is highly unlikely that your boyfriend will step up for a child when he can't step up for a relationship.\n\nGood luck,",

I know it's cliche to say this but you have to keep on in life. Honor all your loved ones who have passed. Keep their memories alive. Talk to them when you are alone.  I think maybe joining a grief support group would be beneficial for you. Therapy as well. Just to work through everything and to have support. I know that you may feel alone, depressed or scared. Look online, research grief groups. There is support out there. You will gain friendships from the support groups. You may even gain an additional  family. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would bring you into their family like you are their own and you are deserving of that. \u2764\ufe0f",

It doesn\u2019t happen every single time where I throw but sometimes I will lose on purpose. When I play with her I don\u2019t really care about the outcome and I just know that if I lose on purpose she ends up so so much happier. It\u2019s always so so cute to hear her celebrations and everything of the sort especially when she thinks she can\u2019t win. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long while now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop I just love seeing her so so happy. ",

This is not a choice, i want to love and be loved, it\u2019s not my fault my childhood trauma affects my adult relationships but it\u2019s my responsibility to fix it.",

But I respond to enlighten you that just as I cannot understand your experience, there are avoidant experiences you likely cannot fathom. \n\nI am a secure earned avoidant follow a dv relationship that I left, and then my partner overdosed. I have watched myself slowly close up from very outgoing to very avoidant and can go days, weeks without responding because  I feel the pressure to but want to avoid confrontation. I will avoid work when it's plaguing me with anxiety until it's too much to bear, then get everything done in one long day (currently). I will think of my friends but feel unable to reach out or respond because I feel ashamed of my behavior. I will lock myself in a room unable to call my family, even though I really miss them, because my shame is so strong and run 7 miles to get out of the house or make up an excuse. \n\nI'm on a family vacation and feeling guilty they are all at dinner and I am at home, on reddit, and as much as I love them I needed to take my space this one day to get through the next few days or my head will explode. \n\n  \nI feel alone in a crowded room of people, even though I'm showered with attention I don't believe I deserve. I can perform under pressure, am an ambitious person, and make friends easily that I struggle to communicate with for weeks of avoidant behavior. \n\nI am always waiting to date unless it is a whirlwind romance and accidentally ghost people because I'm so in my head. I am waiting to be perfect, for everything to align, to give myself permission to feel. \n\nI am working through my problems, but nothing is black and white. So many people seem intrigued by my life and think I live the dream, but I am really alone. You can lie next to someone but never really know how they feel, just as I cannot understand how you feel. But you can love them where they are at, continue to work on yourself, and try to understand where they stand. \n\nWhat this person lacks is not the ability to change, but the effort to take a step to meet you where you need. Maybe you can push them, and maybe not, but if you continue to work and identify your own patterns surely you'll find yourself in a healthier place",

Not to say avoidant attachment isn\u2019t a thing - it is - but I\u2019ve dated a few people like this who went on to date other people they treated differently. It can be painful, but it\u2019s important to be realistic and realize when a relationship just isn\u2019t working, and when it\u2019s one-sided. And psychoanalyzing your partner can be unhealthy. If someone makes you feel undervalued, it\u2019s okay to move on without picking apart the reason for it. \n\n2) Attachment styles aren\u2019t like zodiac signs, or something that\u2019s assigned to you permanently at birth. Everyone can put in work to improve their attachment style, no matter which one you have, and this should be the goal. A good partner isn\u2019t someone who is one style or the other - a good partner is someone who wants to improve. There isn\u2019t inherent virtue in being anxious instead of avoidant. There is only virtue in trying to be better.\n\n3) No attachment style is easy unless you\u2019re secure. They all stem from trauma. I could say the same thing as you about anxiously attached people, as someone who has a disorganized attachment - but I wouldn\u2019t, because I know we are all entitled to our own feelings, and our struggles all matter, even if they\u2019re different.",

I am blessed to be aware of it, and I can only imagine how hurtful my avoidance is to others. \n\nBut it is not easy for us too. I'm bottling up feelings, in fear of rejection. I know I'm being unreasonable, I know I'm giving the cold shoulder, and I want nothing more but to apologize and face the issues head-on together and show that I do care. I'm too fearful of rejection, of being judged, of being hated, that I rather bottle it all up and pretend the bad things don't exist. Which is wrong, and I know. \n\nI'm learning, and I'm doing my best to show more thought and care to the people I hold dear. But it takes time to heal from lifelong trauma that has made you this way. When you never learned how to deal with problems and have to teach yourself to be the bigger person, to be a kind and thoughtful person and to properly communicate when there are problems, it is hard and takes time. There are setbacks, but as long as we keep trying hard and working on ourselves, we can master this too and learn how to deal with these things more appropriately.",
