I work in retail management and this particular company could not be more awful. Last week I finally decided I was fed up. \n\nAfter a grueling 4 interview process over the last week I was just offered a position at a significantly better company for: \n\nA. $25,000 more per year base salary \nB. 30mins closer to my house \nC. In a much safer area\n\nAfter the most challenging year of my life, I can honestly say this is the win I needed to keep me pushing. I hope everyone has a great weekend, thanks for reading.  ",

I had a girl I work with lose about 80lb and I didn't say anything to her specifically because I didn't want to offend her as if I was monitoring/watching her weight loss progress. I also wasn't sure if she lost it due to medical reasons. So if you're losing a lot of weight in a small amount of time that could be the case.  If she had brought up a diet or eating healthy or exercising then I would've come right in and told her how awesome she looked, but she was super quiet about it so that also made me hesitate.",

I never know what\u2019s going on, maybe they have an eating disorder, or are going through chemo, and I don\u2019t want to put my foot in my mouth by praising them for losing weight.\n\nPlus I had a friend who lost a bunch of weight and everyone told her how great she looked and it made her feel like she must have looked awful before. She unfortunately regained the weight later and those comments made her feel like everyone must secretly be thinking she looks terrible.\n\nAll that to say people may have noticed your weight loss but don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to comment. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I did have a coworker who was losing tons of weight and I didn\u2019t say a word. She then mentioned in casual conversation that her doctor had started her on ozempic and she was so happy to be losing weight. I then felt comfortable congratulating her and talking over different clothing styles that might look great on her new frame. So it\u2019s possible that if you open the conversational door that you are doing this safely and are happy with your progress that people will be more comfortable chatting with you about it.\n\nRegardless, congratulations and be proud of what I\u2019m sure was a lot of hard work. I wish you health and happiness in your own skin!",

Now im too religious to do anything since i'm scared of hellfire lol. Some will say its a good thing, but I don't think so. (And pls don't recommend therapy, idc and it won't help) \nAlso, a lot their family hold them from doing it, they don't wanna make them feel sad and don't wanna do this to their parents but then to me when I try to give hints to my mom, she roll her eyes.
