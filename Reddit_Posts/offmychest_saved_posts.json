I work in retail management and this particular company could not be more awful. Last week I finally decided I was fed up. \n\nAfter a grueling 4 interview process over the last week I was just offered a position at a significantly better company for: \n\nA. $25,000 more per year base salary \nB. 30mins closer to my house \nC. In a much safer area\n\nAfter the most challenging year of my life, I can honestly say this is the win I needed to keep me pushing. I hope everyone has a great weekend, thanks for reading.  ",

I also wasn't sure if she lost it due to medical reasons. So if you're losing a lot of weight in a small amount of time that could be the case.  If she had brought up a diet or eating healthy or exercising then I would've come right in and told her how awesome she looked, but she was super quiet about it so that also made me hesitate.",

I never know what\u2019s going on, maybe they have an eating disorder, or are going through chemo, and I don\u2019t want to put my foot in my mouth by praising them for losing weight.\n\nPlus I had a friend who lost a bunch of weight and everyone told her how great she looked and it made her feel like she must have looked awful before. She unfortunately regained the weight later and those comments made her feel like everyone must secretly be thinking she looks terrible.\n\nAll that to say people may have noticed your weight loss but don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to comment. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I did have a coworker who was losing tons of weight and I didn\u2019t say a word. She then mentioned in casual conversation that her doctor had started her on ozempic and she was so happy to be losing weight. I then felt comfortable congratulating her and talking over different clothing styles that might look great on her new frame. So it\u2019s possible that if you open the conversational door that you are doing this safely and are happy with your progress that people will be more comfortable chatting with you about it.\n\nRegardless, congratulations and be proud of what I\u2019m sure was a lot of hard work.

The fun in life doesn't have to end just because you've reached \"adulthood.\" To many people, you are still a child, so let yourself be one! The hard parts of adulthood will eventually grow to be normal for you, but I understand that it's scary now. I know it seems like it's the end of world but it's not. In fact, there's so much out there for you to still experience! There have so many people I've met and absolutely amazing opportunities/experiences I've had as a young adult that I'm grateful for. All of them are things I only got to experience because I'm an adult, because I grew up a bit. I just wanted to tell you that the things that scare you about starting adulthood won't scare you as much once you've actually lived through it a bit. Life can be very, very hard, yes, but I hope you have friends and family that can help you along the way too when you're struggling, when the fear of the future becomes too much. Have hope for yourself. If things aren't how you expected them to be, the good thing about growing up is that you have more power to change things, to make your life how you see fit. But you only have that power if you let yourself embrace that change. \n\nThere's still so much more to life than all your fears for the future. Let yourself explore, make mistakes, party, and do all the things you want to do. That's what this period of your life is for. \n\nSorry for the long reply but this is something I was actually thinking about recently, as I wrote a \"letter to my past self\" a couple weeks ago.",

Pregnancy;\nYou need to make a decision as a single entity.\nSo questions to consider;\nCan you keep this child?\nHow are your finances? Can you support it? How about emotionally? How big is your village? Will you receive help from friends and family? What are your life goals? Will this baby move you towards or away or neither?\n\nAfter you know where you stand and what you want. Then you can consider having a discussion with your boyfriend. But know always where you stand before an argument/negotiation/decision in your life.\n\nPregnancy always always changes the life of the mother more than the father. Do not underestimate it. \n\n2. Cheating:\nWhere do you stand in cheating? What is the context behind it ?\nSome individuals are black and white and don't tolerate any cheating. Others aren't, and sometimes, albeit rarely it can lead to couples therapy and overall relationship improvement.\n\nWhat do you want? That is the most important thing \nIt is your body and your relationship.\n\nHowever, realistically, it is highly unlikely that your boyfriend will step up for a child when he can't step up for a relationship.\n\nGood luck,",

I know it's cliche to say this but you have to keep on in life. Honor all your loved ones who have passed. Keep their memories alive. Talk to them when you are alone.  I think maybe joining a grief support group would be beneficial for you. Therapy as well. Just to work through everything and to have support. I know that you may feel alone, depressed or scared. Look online, research grief groups. There is support out there. You will gain friendships from the support groups. You may even gain an additional  family. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who would bring you into their family like you are their own and you are deserving of that. \u2764\ufe0f",

It doesn\u2019t happen every single time where I throw but sometimes I will lose on purpose. When I play with her I don\u2019t really care about the outcome and I just know that if I lose on purpose she ends up so so much happier. It\u2019s always so so cute to hear her celebrations and everything of the sort especially when she thinks she can\u2019t win. I\u2019ve been doing it for a long while now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop I just love seeing her so so happy. ",

This is not a choice, i want to love and be loved, it\u2019s not my fault my childhood trauma affects my adult relationships but it\u2019s my responsibility to fix it.",

But I respond to enlighten you that just as I cannot understand your experience, there are avoidant experiences you likely cannot fathom. \n\nI am a secure earned avoidant follow a dv relationship that I left, and then my partner overdosed. I have watched myself slowly close up from very outgoing to very avoidant and can go days, weeks without responding because  I feel the pressure to but want to avoid confrontation. I will avoid work when it's plaguing me with anxiety until it's too much to bear, then get everything done in one long day (currently). I will think of my friends but feel unable to reach out or respond because I feel ashamed of my behavior. I will lock myself in a room unable to call my family, even though I really miss them, because my shame is so strong and run 7 miles to get out of the house or make up an excuse. \n\nI'm on a family vacation and feeling guilty they are all at dinner and I am at home, on reddit, and as much as I love them I needed to take my space this one day to get through the next few days or my head will explode. \n\n  \nI feel alone in a crowded room of people, even though I'm showered with attention I don't believe I deserve. I can perform under pressure, am an ambitious person, and make friends easily that I struggle to communicate with for weeks of avoidant behavior. \n\nI am always waiting to date unless it is a whirlwind romance and accidentally ghost people because I'm so in my head. I am waiting to be perfect, for everything to align, to give myself permission to feel. \n\nI am working through my problems, but nothing is black and white. So many people seem intrigued by my life and think I live the dream, but I am really alone. You can lie next to someone but never really know how they feel, just as I cannot understand how you feel. But you can love them where they are at, continue to work on yourself, and try to understand where they stand. \n\nWhat this person lacks is not the ability to change, but the effort to take a step to meet you where you need. Maybe you can push them, and maybe not, but if you continue to work and identify your own patterns surely you'll find yourself in a healthier place",

Not to say avoidant attachment isn\u2019t a thing - it is - but I\u2019ve dated a few people like this who went on to date other people they treated differently. It can be painful, but it\u2019s important to be realistic and realize when a relationship just isn\u2019t working, and when it\u2019s one-sided. And psychoanalyzing your partner can be unhealthy. If someone makes you feel undervalued, it\u2019s okay to move on without picking apart the reason for it. \n\n2) Attachment styles aren\u2019t like zodiac signs, or something that\u2019s assigned to you permanently at birth. Everyone can put in work to improve their attachment style, no matter which one you have, and this should be the goal. A good partner isn\u2019t someone who is one style or the other - a good partner is someone who wants to improve. There isn\u2019t inherent virtue in being anxious instead of avoidant. There is only virtue in trying to be better.\n\n3) No attachment style is easy unless you\u2019re secure. They all stem from trauma. I could say the same thing as you about anxiously attached people, as someone who has a disorganized attachment - but I wouldn\u2019t, because I know we are all entitled to our own feelings, and our struggles all matter, even if they\u2019re different.",

I am blessed to be aware of it, and I can only imagine how hurtful my avoidance is to others. \n\nBut it is not easy for us too. I'm bottling up feelings, in fear of rejection. I know I'm being unreasonable, I know I'm giving the cold shoulder, and I want nothing more but to apologize and face the issues head-on together and show that I do care. I'm too fearful of rejection, of being judged, of being hated, that I rather bottle it all up and pretend the bad things don't exist. Which is wrong, and I know. \n\nI'm learning, and I'm doing my best to show more thought and care to the people I hold dear. But it takes time to heal from lifelong trauma that has made you this way. When you never learned how to deal with problems and have to teach yourself to be the bigger person, to be a kind and thoughtful person and to properly communicate when there are problems, it is hard and takes time. There are setbacks, but as long as we keep trying hard and working on ourselves, we can master this too and learn how to deal with these things more appropriately.",

This year they both turned 21, so i was like ok let's fly him out here (we're in Vegas) and you guys can meet in person or whatever.  Cool cool cool.\n\nI know he's a real person because i see them FaceTime and all. I just had this feeling he would come up with something to not come.  The story is,  his mom booked a cruise for that week. I asked didn't she know he was coming here. Anyway, that doesn't matter, it's just a weird flimsy excuse.\n\nI'm kind of mad, just because my kid got their hopes up and got upset (everything is OK now) but I'm not really that upset.  I kind of feel bad for not being more angry, but also it's just a weird fact of life on the internet. \n\nThanks if you read this,  i just had to get it out\n\n",

The fact that for a whole year, neither really put in the proper effort to meet until now is kind of\u2026 meh. And now that you guys finally did, he flaked. \nI always hate being the one offering unsolicited advice, but I think it\u2019s worth having a conversation with your daughter and explain that she deserves better. It\u2019s often hard for us youngsters to realise and accept that fact. If hypothetically they would want to turn this into a more serious relationship, maybe one involving marriage and things, one of them would be put in the position to compromise and move to the other\u2019s state.

It doesn't mean being involved all the time, but simply letting her know you're there if she needs help with something, you'd be happy to pop in and help with a task-like changing a light bulb, opening stiff jar lids, moving something heavy etc. And also maybe just invite her in for a cup of tea and cake once in a while. Give her a call and ask how she's doing and have a brief chat once in a while etc. Offer to pick something up from the grocery shop if she needs something.  Just letting her know you're there if she needs something. And so she's not so lonely. \n\nIt sounds like her sons aren't very involved in her life, which is really sad. I get there may be reasons we don't know about, maybe they live far away or have families of their own with busy work schedule and kids activities etc, but they should still make time to see her or talk on phone etc. Especially given the losses she's experienced and her age. \n\nIt can make a big difference to her to know so.eone cares and is looking out for her etc. \n\nI'm disabled, 41yrs old, and 7 years ago I moved into a bungalow. One neighbour happens to be related to my sister in law, and back then my other neighbour used to be an elderly gentleman. Everytime we saw each other at the front door, he'd stand chatting to me for ages (I had to get a fold up chair coz of back problems, so I kept one near front door and one near back door as our garden fence was only half sizes he'd chat over the garden fence too lol so I'd grab my chair while we talked)  He seemed lonely, and like our chats were the highlight of his day, as he only had a relative he met with once a week, other than that he was quite lonely. \nBut when I moved in, he took it on himself to put my bins out for me as he knew I had a bad back. The other neighbour whose related to sister in law gave me his number straight away in a card with an orchid as a welcome gift saying to call him if I needed help with anything, and to come for a cuppa and chat any time. Over the years he's helped me with lots of things like moving furniture or bringing cat litter from my car in to the bungalow, and I'd go round for a chat every so often. It meant a lot to know they were looking out for me and were happy to help with anything I needed. \nSo I'm sure she'd feel grateful if you did the same for her. \n\nIt's also important just to keep an eye out for signs of something wrong, like if she doesn't open her curtains one morning for eg. My parents once had an elderly neighbour and one day they saw his curtains still closed and milk still sitting at the front door. There was no answer when they knocked, so my dad and another neighbour got a ladder to an open bedroom window, climbed in and found him unconscious and almost dead in bed. My dad did cpr till ambulance came. He lived long enough for his family to go say goodbye at the hospital before he passed. They were so grateful that his neighbours looked out for him etc. \n\nSo if you can, keep an eye out, give her your phone number if you're happy to, or tell her to knock if she needs help with something, and maybe just have her over for a cuppa once in a while. I'm sure it would mean the world to her.",

So I took it and when the results came I was surprised to see that I'm 98% Mesoamerican and Andean. For a while this made me laugh thinking this meant I was nearly as Mexican as you can be. I knew very little about Mesoamerican or Andean history.\n\nNow I'm also learning Spanish and my prof recently taught us why so many people from Spanish speaking countries look so diverse...colonizing. I'm no stranger to colonizing, I'm Canadian and Canada has *history* with this, but to sit there in class learning about this and slowly realize that I'm **Native American,** not just Mexican was a bit. Nothing dramatic happened but recently it just kinda dawns on me now and then leaving me feeling odd. Just odd. \n\nAnywho that's it. Just wanted to express my odd feelings to strangers.",

Usually it says with the low percentage heritage that it is actually around 30% probability of you being 2% native something.\nMoreover it means your DNA matches with the DNA of the ppl in that area. But that does not necessarily mean causation. Your DNA is more complex, and there are more reasons upon inheritance why it is the way it is.\nOf course some parts of these can be only inherited, and your DNA cannot mutate into that sequence randomly.\nSo make sure you check the maths and their data of your actual tests before you believe anything its shiny graphs says.",
