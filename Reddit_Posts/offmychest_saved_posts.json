He said i feel uncomfortable and i do not care how he feels?? And i could have just found a female derm. Which i couldn\u2019t initially when i made an appointment. Now they have some appointment for next week, but i can barely sleep over my moles, it stressing me out. So i let him check it with fully covered drape. I dont understand what the issue is?? ",

Your priority has been your mom's comfort and quality of life this whole time. Which is how it should be. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people like your brother. They don't care about their actual family. They just care about their possessions. It's a whole thing. I don't get it either.

It happens every single day. Just look out for that.

You will need to practice great impulse control. This is your challenge. The calmer you are, the more powerful you are.",

It doesn't mean being involved all the time, but simply letting her know you're there if she needs help with something, you'd be happy to pop in and help with a task-like changing a light bulb, opening stiff jar lids, moving something heavy etc. And also maybe just invite her in for a cup of tea and cake once in a while. Give her a call and ask how she's doing and have a brief chat once in a while etc. Offer to pick something up from the grocery shop if she needs something.  Just letting her know you're there if she needs something. And so she's not so lonely. \n\nIt sounds like her sons aren't very involved in her life, which is really sad. I get there may be reasons we don't know about, maybe they live far away or have families of their own with busy work schedule and kids activities etc, but they should still make time to see her or talk on phone etc. Especially given the losses she's experienced and her age. \n\nIt can make a big difference to her to know so.eone cares and is looking out for her etc. \n\nI'm disabled, 41yrs old, and 7 years ago I moved into a bungalow. One neighbour happens to be related to my sister in law, and back then my other neighbour used to be an elderly gentleman. Everytime we saw each other at the front door, he'd stand chatting to me for ages (I had to get a fold up chair coz of back problems, so I kept one near front door and one near back door as our garden fence was only half sizes he'd chat over the garden fence too lol so I'd grab my chair while we talked)  He seemed lonely, and like our chats were the highlight of his day, as he only had a relative he met with once a week, other than that he was quite lonely. \nBut when I moved in, he took it on himself to put my bins out for me as he knew I had a bad back. The other neighbour whose related to sister in law gave me his number straight away in a card with an orchid as a welcome gift saying to call him if I needed help with anything, and to come for a cuppa and chat any time. Over the years he's helped me with lots of things like moving furniture or bringing cat litter from my car in to the bungalow, and I'd go round for a chat every so often. It meant a lot to know they were looking out for me and were happy to help with anything I needed. \nSo I'm sure she'd feel grateful if you did the same for her. \n\nIt's also important just to keep an eye out for signs of something wrong, like if she doesn't open her curtains one morning for eg. My parents once had an elderly neighbour and one day they saw his curtains still closed and milk still sitting at the front door. There was no answer when they knocked, so my dad and another neighbour got a ladder to an open bedroom window, climbed in and found him unconscious and almost dead in bed. My dad did cpr till ambulance came. He lived long enough for his family to go say goodbye at the hospital before he passed. They were so grateful that his neighbours looked out for him etc. \n\nSo if you can, keep an eye out, give her your phone number if you're happy to, or tell her to knock if she needs help with something, and maybe just have her over for a cuppa once in a while. I'm sure it would mean the world to her.",

So let\u2019s talk about it. \nIf you decided no treatment no chemo, then this gives you symptomless time. Which means some things you have time todo with out a symptom shutting your body down to handle. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case you have the capability to get a living trust and organize your wants. If not then I\u2019ll tell you now that this will make your belongings and assets secure and organized. It takes 2-4 weeks total. Most of it is through a lawyer a living trust lawyer that will help you on all the paper work. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about with treatment, cancer like yours I personally knew a lil boy who had it and was on chemo 5 years. It was difficult but he pulled through. With treatment it gives some time but it sounds like you were already told the options.\nSo you know that medically you\u2019ll be watched and supervised and under serious treatment if you had chosen that.\n\nPast this , I wanted to mention this as it\u2019s usual protocol with myeloma. \n\nHopefully you have a abvance directive. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about death.\n\nDeath is not only independent but it\u2019s also a long process. While passing, to keep you as comfortable as possible morphine and steroids will be giving. \nYour mind will be thinking. What makes death stressful is any regrets that you might have. Unfinished business, this makes inflammation and your peace of mind very uncomfortable. \n\nUnderstand that it\u2019s about acceptance and knowing your life was lived to your terms. While you have a year think of what you need to clear up. So that regrets, negative moments will not be your larger thought portion. \n\nGeorge Washington on his death bed, knew when he was dying. He said \u201c I am dying and all is well\u201d. He called his lawyer took care of his will and very peacefully passed. \n\nThis is what I am hoping for you as well. Acceptance to fullest and a peace of knowing all is okay. \n\nMajority of patients who passed did not want people in the room. However that wasn\u2019t communicated, it was done by an action.  So while some family members had a whole group, and one women even brought her soup. The patient would wait till they were gone. This is a generalize thing. It independent and not the same preference for all. \n\nWhy NODA exist is because loved ones can\u2019t be there while someone\u2019s passing. So the need to not be alone is there, but it\u2019s really the reassurance. To keep you comfortable. By keeping your lips chappsticked, music playing, books read, talking.\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s a moment where you will have a last right. We call it a last right as this is when you will crave something or truly want something. \n\nI once had a patient who was coma dosed for two weeks, suddenly wake up, all vitals were good even better, and ask for a Pepsi. I got him a cold Pepsi. Opened it for him and he took one sip, tiniest you can imagine and that was it. He closed his eyes and passed. \nAnother asked for his wife\u2019s soup, she rushed and came with this bowl and he ate the whole thing, again vitals looked amazing. She left with love and he passed with a full stomach. \nLast rights are sudden, unexpected and usually something you will be fullfill by. \n\n\nSince death is independent where you die is also. One man asked for the toilet, he passed on the toilet as his choice. He said, I\u2019d like to go where I had always gone. \n\nHowever you go, you will be kept comfortable, you will be understanding what\u2019s happening and you will want to have a peace of mind. Acceptance makes death less inflamed, less difficult, and more about the now or moment. \n\nIt was Christmas last year and my last patient was deaf, adult who was also autistic. He was known in our valley as an orphan. However very good man. I went in with Christmas music and my pathophysiology book and read to him. He hummed when rocking around the Christmas tree came on. We were also in the ICU. He had contracted C-Diff. The mood before  got there somber and depressing. The mood after I left, we were humming passing out hot chocolate and coffee to our volunteers and my patient was feeling the vibration and knew I was there. We squeezed hands and I left, and so did he. \n\nIt\u2019s always your choice on when to go. It\u2019s however still a process for the rest of you to follow. Kinda like playing catch up. So keep your self relaxed and acceptance and re assure yourself. To have a good death. \n\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about your loved ones, they will not be on the same mindset as you. They won\u2019t be able to be on the same, they\u2019ll be thinking of missing vs letting go. This is why you have your reassurance gives them assurance. To let go and be as comfortable as you are. That you\u2019d like this moment to be about saying good bye. Tears are an automatic and that\u2019s okay, emotions are good and you are loved. But it\u2019s even better, to be at peace yourself and it\u2019ll give them the confidence. \n\nUnderstand that they\u2019ll be on what they had and that\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s an adjustment. So how do you advise others to keep living and living well? \n\nYou will be dead, you won\u2019t be missing and you will know you had a life you had. Out of any thing, they can have confidence in missing you, in times you had and in death. To say goodbye is not always a goodbye. But a reminder that genuine love is worth the good experience and to keep that going. \n\nVery different than the person passing. So let\u2019s make this last note clear. \n\nYou will be okay, to pass. You will have a peaceful one and you get to have moments like now to clear your conscious and concerns and you can let go. \n\nIf you have any questions you are welcome to ask, I\u2019m hear for you.  Rooting for you to have a peaceful death.",

They are not responsible for your debt. \nTaking action on things will give you a sense of control making the emotional side a little less overwhelming. \nI also say I'm dying numerous times a day.  I want to take the power away from that phrase. I say it like I would say pass the salt. So that it becomes familiar and common. It's my way of getting my husband and son to start dealing with the situation.  I also did this when I was diagnosed with cancer. Both are such scary words. \nGo away for a few days to someplace you have always wanted to go. Go alone. No one else to take care of or consider..be alone with the fact that you are dying and start to process it. \nThink about how you want to die. Vermont has physician-assistant euthanasia and they allow you to go there and do it even if you don't live there. \nI could write a million business things that should be considered.  The emotional side of things is trickier. Take the trip first. It will make the rest easier once you have come to terms with it. \nAnd maybe consider a celebration of life party before you die. It's a chance to say goodbye to everyone.  Tell stories and laugh and drink and dance like there is no tomorrow.  The ones that I have been to were so very special.  Way more meaningful than a funeral.  \nI'm truly sorry that you are going through this. But you can do it. You have no choice.  So do it your way.",

A friend of hers noticed a lump right by her ear and recommended that she see a doctor about it. The doctor diagnosed it as cancerous.\n\nShe had to get salivary gland removal surgery, which went pretty well aside from a bit of unexpected swelling that eventually subsided. She also has a mass on her spine that was very worrying, but the biopsy just came back negative. She won't need radiation, but they'll just have to keep an eye on it.

The strength both of you have shown through this is honestly so inspiring.  lThe fact that her surgery went well, and the mass on her spine is benign is amazing news! I know there was probably so much anxiety surrounding that biopsy, and hearing that she won\u2019t need radiation is such a huge relief. I\u2019m glad the doctors are keeping a close eye on everything, but it sounds like she\u2019s truly come through the worst of it.

Telling someone is a good first step. However, unless you intend to start your journey with medical help (which in some cases can't be avoided), consider making that first person you tell someone other than your doctor.

Not great for things like trying to buy life insurance later.\n\n\nAgain - not trying to discourage anyone from seeking medical help if they think they need it - expensive insurance is better than cirrhosis.

I went through a lot of heartbreaks and different things and there were times I didn\u2019t want to keep going. But slowly, day by day, life taught me lessons.

I even started playing the cello, and soon I\u2019ll be taking singing lessons. I\u2019m turning 35 this year, and I\u2019m finally doing what I truly want to do.\n\nWe all have our demons, but as you get older, you learn how to handle them.

Bikes! Walk in a park!)\n- appreciate something beautiful \n- (optional) with good company\n\nIt was on the third day that I was eating a piece of chocolate on the couch after a long day with my friend while we were listening to a Spotify playlist that it hit me.\n\nI can do this every day.\n\nSo I did. It turns out, if your life\u2019s passion is eating chocolate while reading a good book someplace beautiful, you can get EXTREMELY ambitious with it. My favorite place so far has been the bottom of the Grand Canyon, but I have a comfy corner in my room with a nice candle where I practice my Life\u2019s Purpose Daily Ritual of reading for 15 mins with some good dark chocolate.\n\nKeep going. Find the shortlist of things where if you do them, it\u2019s A Good Day. Maybe that\u2019s cuddling a pet or spending 10 mins to text a friend maybe it\u2019s listening to your favorite song or reading a good book. Maybe it\u2019s getting in bed 10 mins earlier than normal and just lying there and being comfy. The cool thing is that you\u2019re a teenager and you\u2019re just starting to have the opportunity to try some out and find what works, and what doesn\u2019t work for you.",

Of course humans have a natural horrible fear of them. When I was a child I had a bad fear of cockroaches, then I started training myself to not be scared when I saw one. As soon as I wasn't scared of them, one flew right at my face. I am convinced cockroaches are sadistic. They're basically stalkers, they go towards humans and love to see humans in pain, so humans must be constantly looking out for those things and even when not being actively tortured by an actual cockroach, they still feel them all over their body. It's so horrible, I hate them so much. I think we have an evolutionary reason to fear them, and I wouldn't be surprised if people used remote controlled cockroaches as torture devices.",

It\u2019s okay to feel numb, or angry, or sad, or lost, even confusion is okay. It\u2019s okay to not know how to label these feelings, either. I know this may not help, but do try to remember that it will get easier\u2014 it might not be tomorrow or a month from now or even a year from now, but it will get easier to remember them. It will always be bittersweet, but their impact on you will be more than the grief someday. \n\nSecondly, regarding your mother. It\u2019s normal to have mixed emotions here, too. Cognitive dissonance is common, I think, when we know someone so well and they do something that contradicts what we know about them. Your mother made a bad decision, that is clear, and it is not right of her to switch the blame onto anyone else. She may have felt lonely or stressed or like she didn\u2019t have anyone to care for her, and that may have motivated her decision\u2014 but that does not excuse that she did something that would hurt her family. I would suggest to her seeking therapy to figure out what exactly motivated her, and to reflect and grow from that bad choice. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to forgive her for hurting you or your father. I think you should take time to figure out what sort of boundaries you want to set with her \u2014 whatever those may be. You can talk to people you trust to determine what your boundary needs are.\n\n\nWishing you the best",

Something I\u2019ve always found cringeworthy is seeing corporate bros still rocking their VIP lanyards after hours, like it\u2019s some kind of flex. Names, companies, and job titles are out there for anyone to see, while they're making questionable decisions. Some of these guys are married, and it was clear they weren\u2019t there to network.\n\nI\u2019ve been on the speaking circuit at conferences for over a decade, and this is something that always stands out to me. It's like some people are more focused on the badge than being smart about their actions. What happens when a boss, a client, or worse, their spouse, sees that? It\u2019s a risky game.\n\nAm I the only one who thinks this kind of behavior reflects badly not just on them but also on their company? Or is this just the norm now?",

In my experience it's not a flex, it's a signal, not unlike wearing a team shirt to a sports bar. It lets other conference goers identify each other at a public venue like the hotel bar, and whether it is there or a private post-event party, it provides the same basic ice-breaking information e.g. name and employer, which can really streamline networking.\n\nAs a young-woman-in-tech at the time, it also gave me cover to start networking conversations with men with the chance they might not automatically assume I was flirting. And as another poster mentioned, cuts down the likelihood of getting hit on and some cover when you do... guy starts sounding a little flirty you can change the subject and ask him how he thinks the last product launch went at company-he-works for, which will often get him to step back. Also he is less likely to cross a line when he realizes that, say, he is a tech journo and you work for one of the biggest tech companies in the world.",

My grandmother has had a lot of pets since then, including several lovely dogs who she loved a great deal-- my parents just took in her current dog, because at 94 she finally felt she was no longer up to the task of caring for a high-energy, 85-pound golden doodle, and he's a happy, healthy boy who is loving his new home with a dog-friend who's just as high-energy as he is.\n\nI guess I just wanted to reassure you that this kind of thing, as awful as it feels, does happen, and it doesn't mean you're a bad pet owner, or that you didn't or don't love them, or that you won't have a long life with loving pets in the future. You still deserve that. You were doing your best and it was a terrible accident. \n\nThere's also a concept-- the \"normal accident theory\"-- which describes unanticipated interactions of multiple events. It's used to describe much larger events than this, on the grand scale of things, but they're considered unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable, and unavoidable. While there are factors we CAN control, small things that can be changed, I think it might be helpful to remember that a lot of what happened you could never have predicted, and it is NOT your fault, or anyone's.",

We dated for 6 months and part of why we broke up was because I found suggestive conversations on her phone with other men. One of those conversations I now realize was with her now fianc\u00e9e. Now I am just sitting wondering whether he knows we were dating while they were talking (he lives in a different state), and if he did, whether she fed him some story about me as to why they should talk. I just feel dumb and manipulated. I felt that I had moved on from the breakup but now I am getting some familiar painful feelings coming back. I know I never want to date or be friends with her again though. \n\nWhat would you do? \n\nOr would you do nothing at all? (What I am leaning towards)",

There were ways he could have mitigated or dealt with his feelings before they became explosive. He could have voiced his growing frustration to you or a friend as a sounding board. He could build in a physical activity to help vent his frustration (a batting cage, a walk or run outside, I know some folks that keep a few dollar store dishes on hand to smash outside on a tarp). There are better ways to manage stress, and anger than this kind of explosion. He apologized, I assume genuinely, and this indicates he knew his behavior was inappropriate at best. But, it still needs to be addressed. You don\u2019t seem afraid for your own safety so, maybe trying to explain your feelings about this situation and see if he\u2019s willing to maybe do some therapy or take up a physically exerting activity before or after work, alone or together. Outbursts are sometimes a way of seeking support and attention that is hard to ask for. If you do feel unsafe, please don\u2019t hesitate to flee and find support from friends, family or a shelter.

My best advice is to give yourself time and know that you may not actually grieve for weeks or months because you go into survival mode. Be as gentle as you can with yourself.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy making my partner happy, but it gets to a point where I feel emotionally drained. I feel like I'm always the one who puts in more effort, plans the dates, and worries about keeping the relationship alive. Meanwhile, my partners just seem to be there, without making the same effort.\n\nMy last relationship ended two months ago because I couldn't take it anymore. I realized I wasn\u2019t receiving the same love and dedication I was giving. It's frustrating because I don't know if the problem is that I'm expecting too much or if I'm simply choosing the wrong partners. I'm tired and emotionally exhausted from giving so much and not getting the same in return. It hurts because I really want a relationship where both of us are equally committed.",

But being so \u201cgiving\u201d that you are routinely sacrificing yourself is not healthy. You need to learn how to give to YOU first, and how to slowly ease yourself into a mutually giving relationship over time. You don\u2019t go all in all at once.

You are not alone in your feelings, and creating a plan before you leave is the way to go. \n\nI am sorry he left you to suffer alone in your ppd. I hope you are seeing a therapist and can make sure your depression is in check too. Being a single parent is HARD and you will want to make sure your depression is under control. I also don\u2019t recommend major decisions (such as divorce) amidst uncontrolled mental illness.

I was already tearful to begin with and overwhelmed. But instead of being my rock and comfort during that time, my husband took it upon himself to taunt me, call me dramatic, and trivialize my feelings and what I was going through. And while I didn\u2019t necessarily feel like he only started treating me this way postpartum, I never really noticed because I usually don\u2019t show a lot of outward emotion so it was never an issue. It took me over a year to feel like myself again. But the whole experience changed me, changed our marriage, and made me feel differently about him. \n\nI know what you\u2019re feeling is real and valid and I hear you. But you have to wait on making any rash decisions until you are over this hill and feel like yourself again. And unless abuse or infidelity are involved, you need to give yourself some time before doing anything you might regret. Leaving your husband also means splitting custody of your child, so unless you\u2019re also prepared to do that- I would wait on leaving him.",

It\u2019s natural to want physical touch and affection from your partner, and it\u2019s not something to feel ashamed about. Feeling touch-starved can be really isolating and loney, especially when it\u2019s coming from someone you love so deeply.\n\nI imagine this situation leaves you feeling rejected, lonely, and maybe even confused. It\u2019s important to know that your needs and feelings are valid, and wanting to feel connected to your husband doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re asking for too much. It\u2019s about wanting to share that bond and closeness with the person who means the most to you.\n\nIt might help to talk to your husband openly, outside of these moments, and share how this is affecting you emotionally, without placing blame. Maybe there are underlying reasons he\u2019s struggling with intimacy, whether it\u2019s stress, self-image, or something else entirely. Creating a space where both of you can express what you\u2019re feeling\u2014without judgment\u2014could be the first step toward understanding each other better.\n\nAbove all, remember that this doesn\u2019t reflect on your worth or desirability. You deserve to feel wanted and cherished, and I hope you\u2019re able to find a path to healing, whether that\u2019s through open communication, therapy, or other forms of support.  \n\nCant find the heart emoji",

Yesterday was the big 30th birthday & honestly, only my parents (who have been amazing might I add) remembered.\n\nNone of the people whom I consider and consider me as \u201cclose\u201d remembered (I only forgive & understand my boyfriend of 5 years for forgetting because he has been battling glioblastoma for 2 years now and as I have been one of his care-givers, I see that he can\u2019t remember a lot anymore, which is VERY heartbreaking.)\n\nI know that I\u2019m just a run-of-the-mill Joe, & that other people have it a lot worse. With that said, I just hoped that others at least bothered to remember and gave a basic \u201chappy birthday\u201d as they remember others. I remember everyone else's birthday\u2019s and at least I send warm well wishes. I try not to take it badly or personally as I have had this happen before back in my high school days & realize that people tend to not care, but this year it stings a lot more & it\u2019s been more painful. Anyways I just wanted to blow off some steam. Thanks for reading. ",

Contacting these supports does not require you to leave the relationship, though you will be encouraged to take steps to help keep you safe. \n\nAbusive relationships, as you may know or have experienced, tend to follow an escalating pattern often referred to as the cycle of violence. With that in mind, I am guessing that your bf/ex bf\u2019s next steps will be to apologize profusely, make commitments to change, buy you something. This is called the honeymoon/reconciliation phase. After that there may be a period of calm. Next comes the tension build-up where your bf begins blaming you for things, gaslighting, and becomes increasingly agitated until there is another episode of violence. \n\nIf you see yourself in the above, know that the violence tends to escalate with each cycle. Also know that the riskiest time for someone in an abusive relationship is when they have left. This is why a safety plan is an important consideration, whether you leave the relationship or not.",

Once on a flight across China, I got stuck in that row, and the person in front of us chain smoked nonstop the entire 5 hour flight, stopping only to eat or use the restroom. It was torture. Want to see a band at a club or just chill at a bar? Be ready to come home reeking of cigarette smoke with burns in your clothing. Coffee house? Same. House party? Ditto. \n\nI mean, I agree that people smoking around other can be obnoxious, but it's NOTHING like it used to be. It used to be less common for places to not allow smoking than to allow it. In my early 20's pretty much the only places you couldn't smoke were work and church. I remember hanging out with friends and places getting vetoed because you couldn't smoke there. Probably because of this, I actually find vape smoke pretty inoffensive. I mean, I don't want it blown in my face or anything, but it is no where near as noxious as cigarette smoke.",

I know what it's like to be stuck in the cycle of being poor and behind on bills and I didn't want him to fall further down that hole. So I sent him $1000, no strings attached.

Call a state or non state but reputable/local DV agency, they'll be used to this sort of thing and you may even have some extra protections, resources, free services, etc to make use of.\n\nMake use of privacy checkups and other app or site specific guided feature for cyber security. Turn off Google location services on your phone, and turn off location history (it shares a viewable timeline of your locations, user end).\n\nGet a new phone and phone number, and format that phone with a new Google account. It's seriously, seriously worth the peace of mind, even if you gotta make due with a cheapie. Use that one to run all gps on, keep your old one on airplane mode while you're not working on getting your old accounts locked down, or pulling data off and setting up new one. It will just register like the phone is off or out of service.",

Also check devices on things like netflix, amazon etc\n\nLast night I was reading somewhere about an ex hacking phones and went to check my google account settings. My ex was logged in, and the last time he had accessed my account was lunchtime that day. I didn't give him access to my gmail or anything so not sure how he was there, but he was. When we broke up I had changed my password but not the devices. \n\nLike you it's been two years. My ex cheated and was emotionally abusive, and now this as well. I'm not in fear of my life fortunately, but I bet there will be some kind of repercussion - there usually is. I've locked down my social media for now and blocked him on everything.",

My father does this I try getting help but no one helps.  You have to be safe on your own.  Maybe tell the authorities.  Just please be safe.  Don't go anywhere alone with him and please move into a friend's house someone who can protect you from him.  Maybe someone he doesn't know?",
