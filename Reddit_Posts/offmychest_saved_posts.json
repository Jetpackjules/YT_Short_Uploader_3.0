I've been wanting another dog since our last girl left us and our kids have been begging for another dog but my husband didn't want one for the time being (maybe in 5 years he said) I purposely went for clients with the cutest goodest boys to make my husband think he wants a dog. I played it perfectly and my plan seemed to work because he texted me he wants a dog after I've only been watching this couples dogs for 4 hours. I manipulated him so we could get a dog and I feel guilty but I think some good came of this. We will adopt a dog giving them a good life but at the same time I did play at his heart strings to.get what I want..",

He, by himself, told you he wanted a dog. Clearly he wanted one. You didn't coerced him.",

That means you want to be more honest with your spouse. If you truly feel guilty, maybe come out of him? He'll probably laugh it off, but I dont think you need to beat yourself up for it. Judging by this post, you don't sound like a nonempathetic narcisist to me, so I doubt this was in any way manipulation.",

It took me multiple days to write everything, proofread it and rewrite.

She has been working on being better but still fails and even when I say something today she gets defensive.\n\nShe has been in therapy for four years, she is better but not there.  As with everything in life, we are all works in progress.  Keep moving forward and keep fighting for your emotional needs.",
