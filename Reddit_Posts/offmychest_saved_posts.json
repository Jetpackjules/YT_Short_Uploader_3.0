My wife and I are in Hawaii for our 10th wedding anniversary. I knew this would be the time to finally overcome decades of built up insecurities. I mean, we\u2019re in Hawaii, I can\u2019t sit on the side lines like I normally do.  \nI had to buy swim trunks since I never once thought about even owning some. I\u2019ve constantly been hyper aware of how I look, whether I\u2019m around strangers or friends and family. Constantly exerting so much energy worried about what people think of how I look.  \nSo, when it came time to take off my shirt and get in the pool, what happened was\u2026 nothing. No record scratch moment with murmurs of disgust and ridicule. Nothing. All the visions I\u2019ve had in my head of what might happened didn\u2019t come true.  \nInstead I got in the pool and relaxed. Something I haven\u2019t done since I was a kid and free from worry.

As soon as I wasn't scared of them, one flew right at my face. I am convinced cockroaches are sadistic. They're basically stalkers, they go towards humans and love to see humans in pain, so humans must be constantly looking out for those things and even when not being actively tortured by an actual cockroach, they still feel them all over their body.

It\u2019s okay to feel numb, or angry, or sad, or lost, even confusion is okay. It\u2019s okay to not know how to label these feelings, either. I know this may not help, but do try to remember that it will get easier\u2014 it might not be tomorrow or a month from now or even a year from now, but it will get easier to remember them. It will always be bittersweet, but their impact on you will be more than the grief someday. \n\nSecondly, regarding your mother. It\u2019s normal to have mixed emotions here, too. Cognitive dissonance is common, I think, when we know someone so well and they do something that contradicts what we know about them. Your mother made a bad decision, that is clear, and it is not right of her to switch the blame onto anyone else. She may have felt lonely or stressed or like she didn\u2019t have anyone to care for her, and that may have motivated her decision\u2014 but that does not excuse that she did something that would hurt her family. I would suggest to her seeking therapy to figure out what exactly motivated her, and to reflect and grow from that bad choice. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to forgive her for hurting you or your father. I think you should take time to figure out what sort of boundaries you want to set with her \u2014 whatever those may be. You can talk to people you trust to determine what your boundary needs are.\n\n\nWishing you the best",

In my experience it's not a flex, it's a signal, not unlike wearing a team shirt to a sports bar. It lets other conference goers identify each other at a public venue like the hotel bar, and whether it is there or a private post-event party, it provides the same basic ice-breaking information e.g. name and employer, which can really streamline networking.\n\nAs a young-woman-in-tech at the time, it also gave me cover to start networking conversations with men with the chance they might not automatically assume I was flirting. And as another poster mentioned, cuts down the likelihood of getting hit on and some cover when you do... guy starts sounding a little flirty you can change the subject and ask him how he thinks the last product launch went at company-he-works for, which will often get him to step back. Also he is less likely to cross a line when he realizes that, say, he is a tech journo and you work for one of the biggest tech companies in the world.",

My grandmother has had a lot of pets since then, including several lovely dogs who she loved a great deal-- my parents just took in her current dog, because at 94 she finally felt she was no longer up to the task of caring for a high-energy, 85-pound golden doodle, and he's a happy, healthy boy who is loving his new home with a dog-friend who's just as high-energy as he is.\n\nI guess I just wanted to reassure you that this kind of thing, as awful as it feels, does happen, and it doesn't mean you're a bad pet owner, or that you didn't or don't love them, or that you won't have a long life with loving pets in the future. You still deserve that. You were doing your best and it was a terrible accident. \n\nThere's also a concept-- the \"normal accident theory\"-- which describes unanticipated interactions of multiple events. It's used to describe much larger events than this, on the grand scale of things, but they're considered unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable, and unavoidable. While there are factors we CAN control, small things that can be changed, I think it might be helpful to remember that a lot of what happened you could never have predicted, and it is NOT your fault, or anyone's.",

Big hugs!! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n- Came back to add, just in case it seemed I hurt my kitten, he is fine! And now that he's bigger he's easier to see and is learning also not to get underfoot. But I can easily understand how something like this can happen.",

He was refusing to step into the room so he was being forced to walk in, as he was walking in he didn't see the kittens, as he was in the middle of a tantrum and stepped on one of the them. Died the same way, spasms then nothing. This happened when he was about 10 and he's 25 now and still feels bad about it.

I didn\u2019t post or comment anything even remotely offensive or rude, yet people have been horrible to me and have been mass downvoting my comments ever since.\n\nThis morning I looked at the number of downvotes on many of my comments in the thread and I actually started crying.\n\nI\u2019m mad at myself for caring about what anonymous strangers think of me and regret ever posting in the first place.\n\nI guess I just wanted to get this off my chest as the incident put me in a really sad mood.\n\nThanks everyone who read this:)",

The job is mostly remote with some site visit travel - this last month I've been on the road a lot, going to conferences and visiting sites. It's been really really great so far, but I can't shake the feeling that they're spending a lot of money on me. For example, today I'm staying in a $250 hotel room, by myself. As in, my own room! \n\nLike... Is that okay? I'm coming from the food industry and service world, so I'm feeling a bit shellshocked by things being paid for, and support from the org.

Depending on when and how the reservation was made, if it\u2019s for a conference or training with group hotel discounts, etc, it could be perfectly reasonable to put you up there.

These kinds of expenses can and should be written into grants.\n\nThe only thing I can imagine as a concern is if this somehow translated to lower quality programming for clients/ program participants; but typically happy employees are an indicator of better-quality programming with less turnover and more institutional skill and knowledge retention.\n\nI say enjoy working for a place that seems to value its employees!

Three of us hopped into action - two men got her ont of the car (it landed on its side), I called emergency services, and I got a blanket from my car to wrap her in (it was a chilly morning). We sat and talked with her (I made her stay very still because neck injuries are possible and because she kept trying to get up to go to work - at the diner\u2026), and the gents put out the fire that started. Her boss came out and then called her mom (she is a young girl - late teens, early 20s). \n\nMeanwhile, 20 or so people came running out of the restaurant and were snapping pictures and taking video, and I\u2019m like, my dudes. Really? It makes me sick. I get it, but also, why? What are they going to do with those? \n\nAnyway, ambulance came, put her on a board, and I saw her a couple of weeks later at the diner. A few bruises and a concussion, but otherwise a okay. \n\nIf I had happened upon your scene, I\u2019d do what I did: go into first aid and calm them down mode. I may not be a big person (like I\u2019m 5\u20191, seriously), but I can talk to someone while emergency is on the way.",

Once the train came into the station, I alerted the conductor to call police. Do you know the only ones to do so were me and this tiny elderly man? Everyone just recorded.\n\nMy situation ended a lot better than yours, as nobody was stabbed or seriously injured, but it made me lose faith in humanity that people were more interested in recording and being entertained than helping.",

He could build in a physical activity to help vent his frustration (a batting cage, a walk or run outside, I know some folks that keep a few dollar store dishes on hand to smash outside on a tarp). There are better ways to manage stress, and anger than this kind of explosion. He apologized, I assume genuinely, and this indicates he knew his behavior was inappropriate at best.

You don\u2019t seem afraid for your own safety so, maybe trying to explain your feelings about this situation and see if he\u2019s willing to maybe do some therapy or take up a physically exerting activity before or after work, alone or together. Outbursts are sometimes a way of seeking support and attention that is hard to ask for. If you do feel unsafe, please don\u2019t hesitate to flee and find support from friends, family or a shelter.  Kindest wishes to you and your family.",

I had to know why and they said that my ex\u2019s girlfriend will be there. They met four months ago and presumably dating since; we\u2019ve been hooking up for five months. I am devastated and conflicted. I am wishing him a speedy and calm recovery but i feel betrayed. I clearly have to break it off, this is going to be hard to let go. ",

I am an only child, too, it's a difficult thing to navigate because you have to do all of the logistical stuff (funeral, death certificates, notifications, obit, etc) and manage your own grief at the same time. My best advice is to give yourself time and know that you may not actually grieve for weeks or months because you go into survival mode. Be as gentle as you can with yourself. Do you have a regular doctor? If so, they may be able to give you resources. The hospital your mom was in may have those as well.",

It took me over a year to feel like myself again. But the whole experience changed me, changed our marriage, and made me feel differently about him. \n\nI know what you\u2019re feeling is real and valid and I hear you. But you have to wait on making any rash decisions until you are over this hill and feel like yourself again. And unless abuse or infidelity are involved, you need to give yourself some time before doing anything you might regret.

It\u2019s natural to want physical touch and affection from your partner, and it\u2019s not something to feel ashamed about. Feeling touch-starved can be really isolating and loney, especially when it\u2019s coming from someone you love so deeply.\n\nI imagine this situation leaves you feeling rejected, lonely, and maybe even confused. It\u2019s important to know that your needs and feelings are valid, and wanting to feel connected to your husband doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re asking for too much. It\u2019s about wanting to share that bond and closeness with the person who means the most to you.\n\nIt might help to talk to your husband openly, outside of these moments, and share how this is affecting you emotionally, without placing blame. Maybe there are underlying reasons he\u2019s struggling with intimacy, whether it\u2019s stress, self-image, or something else entirely. Creating a space where both of you can express what you\u2019re feeling\u2014without judgment\u2014could be the first step toward understanding each other better.\n\nAbove all, remember that this doesn\u2019t reflect on your worth or desirability. You deserve to feel wanted and cherished, and I hope you\u2019re able to find a path to healing, whether that\u2019s through open communication, therapy, or other forms of support.  \n\nCant find the heart emoji",

Contacting these supports does not require you to leave the relationship, though you will be encouraged to take steps to help keep you safe. \n\nAbusive relationships, as you may know or have experienced, tend to follow an escalating pattern often referred to as the cycle of violence. With that in mind, I am guessing that your bf/ex bf\u2019s next steps will be to apologize profusely, make commitments to change, buy you something. This is called the honeymoon/reconciliation phase. After that there may be a period of calm. Next comes the tension build-up where your bf begins blaming you for things, gaslighting, and becomes increasingly agitated until there is another episode of violence. \n\nIf you see yourself in the above, know that the violence tends to escalate with each cycle. Also know that the riskiest time for someone in an abusive relationship is when they have left. This is why a safety plan is an important consideration, whether you leave the relationship or not.",

Having a kid, especially a neurodiverse one is tough and forces the parents to learn a lot and fail a lot as well, it's not just the kids learning. \n\nBut if you feel like it's gonna happen again or if it happens again, asking for help is one of the bravest things to do. I don't know which resources can be used at your location, but maybe a little break here and there or a professional helping hand could help you and your kiddo with stress/frustration/anger management. \n\n\nI have no kids myself but i worked as a kindergarden teacher and one of the things that helped me the most is learning to pick the fights worth it. If i argue about every misplaced lego, every inside-out sock and every broken toy i would have lost my mind. Maybe there are some fights that you can reduce? \n\nI also learned to let the kids fail on their own terms. He wants to roll on the dirty floor? No problem, but we just showered and don't have time for a second shower right now so (yesterdays clothes for today because we don't want to stain fresh ones with a dirty body/ less cuddle time because cuddling is more fun when everyones clean/...) if there is time for a second shower, there might not be time for play between the second shower and what was planned after that, or maybe the planned activity has to be swapped for a less fun one. \nJust like when an adult doesn't get ready in time and misses their train and is late to work",

They are currently waiting for xray at ER.\n\nMy mom is so calm about it. Dad swears he's fine and I can't wrap my head around it. \n.\n.\n\n\nUpdate: for anyone concerned, dad got up and went to work this morning. ",

I learned that he has a son who he has partial custody of and lives with a roommate who is disabled and can't work full time. We've become pretty good friends. Chris told me that he was behind on his rent and finally admitted today that he was going to be evicted. And I gave him the money. I know what it's like to be stuck in the cycle of being poor and behind on bills and I didn't want him to fall further down that hole. So I sent him $1000, no strings attached. Maybe it's weird to do that, but people have helped me out in big ways before and I saw an opportunity to pay it forward. I'm glad he'll get to stay in his place with his son and that's enough for me. ",

I never realized how bad it was until I noticed the outbursts I had when I am being told something about my drinking. So I thought I can at least do this for myself and my family.\n\n\n\nNow I am 39 days sober. I never really talked about this with anyone. Sometimes I just want to cry, knowing that deep inside, I am struggling. Difficulty sleeping, the headaches, the cravings. My partner was the one who saw the downward spiral of my drinking, it almost hurt our relationship. She is still with me. We are doing amazing. But she seems to avoid talking about me not drinking anymore. Sometimes I feel like the \"achievement\" that I should feel from being sober this long, is pointless. Like nobody noticed the only progress that people keep lecturing me about. That they got what they wanted from me, to stop drinking, but I feel so alone, feeling like drinking was the only thing that kept me feel something and nothing all the same time.\n\n\n\nSo yes. I am 39 days sober. I guess I just needed to let that out since nobody really cares.",

I think they think it's like when you're craving a particular food, and if you get distracted or aren't reminded, you'll forget about it.\n\nHowever my (ex) spouse wouldn't praise not smoking because \"you shouldn't be doing it anyway.

This helped me focus on the positive moments in my life.\n\nI also started doing sports and trying new hobbies, like drawing and yoga. Not only does this distract me from negative thoughts, but it also brings me joy!\n\nI realized that it is important to accept myself as I am, with all my flaws and peculiarities.

Think of something that the whole family can do together \u2026. Make a sweet memory.  \n\nYour daughter needs to work to even begin to be able to understand and appreciate the value of a dollar. She can work when schools out. Xmas (seasonal job at the mall) or summer vacation.

You\u2019re doing your best and you\u2019re still the parent and your kids need to see you being positive about your future. \n\nThe more you expose them to your worry \u2026.\nYou\u2019re doing them a disservice as well. No kid wants to think of their Mom suffering, or, dying \u2026. They can\u2019t flourish if they\u2019re constantly worried about you and your life span.  That\u2019s another reason to find a solution to the worrying. \n\nHang in there",

My mom had pretty much every risk factor of CVD going for her. Instead of doing things to take care of herself, things that reduce the risk of and are protective against CVD and heart attacks, she decided to spend her last couple of years preparing me for her death instead. She died of a heart attack a little less than a year ago when I was 33. Every day since then has felt like the worst day of my life. Please don't see this as a death sentence. You may not live as long as you want to for your kids, but you can do things to improve your outlook. Most risk factors that aren't genetic are related to stress in one way or another, which is really really hard to control, but it is still possible to lower your risk and be with your daughter at least a few more years than you think you will.",

I think about him all the time\u2026what he would think of my career, how he would have helped me when I struggled through calculus, wondering if he would be proud of me, etc. I also have the same genetic, neurodegenerative disease he did. At 41, I am disabled and losing more of myself, mobility, memory, and dexterity everyday. Soon, I will no longer be able to work at the career I love. All that to say, I emphasize with your situation. \n\nWith respect, your daughter is a selfish teenager. I was once one too. Teens sometimes say mean things to their parents. I regret the awful things I said to my mom (at least the ones I remember!) it\u2019s a normal developmental stage. Don\u2019t give in to the guilt or manipulation. \n\nFinancial health is important to preserving your physical health. Being equitable to your kids is important, and your other kids didn\u2019t have such experiences. She will live! I don\u2019t know where you live, but maybe you could take a trip to Paris, Texas? (They have an Eiffel Tower too). A more moderate gesture could still make her feel special while not breaking the bank. \n\nI don\u2019t know about anyone else, but my most treasured memories weren\u2019t made of expensive things. They\u2019re made of quality time spent with those whom I treasure. I\u2019ve lived in Africa, Europe (lived in Paris), and the US. Been to every continent. While those travels were definitely amazing and made for great memories, my favorite memories include going to the county fair with my dad, Christmas spent with family in Europe, piling on the car to look at Christmas lights, a square dance at my church, and similar. Money doesn\u2019t make memories- the people you love do. \n\nDon\u2019t give up hope. None of us know what medical achievements may improve our quality of life or extend our time on this earth! And cliche as it may sound, treat everyday as a gift and make the most of it. \n\nYou can always write your kids letters to be opened in the future (whether you\u2019re gone or not). The sweetest gift I ever received was a silly touristy keychain from San Francisco that my dad bought when I was 2. It was given to me for my 16th birthday, and you cannot know what that trinket meant. It wasn\u2019t a keychain. It was my dad thinking 14 years in the future for me to have something special when I started to drive. The smallest gestures can mean the most. Plan for those moments for all your children. It will leave an indelible mark on their heart to know you loved them so very much. Trust me, your baby will appreciate that far more than a trip to Paris. \n\nBe well \u2764\ufe0f",

I have been a mess. \n\nI have now found out throughout the whole time of finding out that she has cancer to her dying, he\u2019s been sleeping with another woman, so he\u2019s being seeing her for around 8 months. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do, he was supposed to be the person I trusted, he was supposed to support me at my lowest. I didn\u2019t think anyone could be so cruel. ",

I was so upset because I had just finish paying it off and the stress of getting quotes for the repairs and then deciding to just replace it was a lot ( I hate trying to negociate with dealers). This week I finally got a new vehicle. It took me 2-3 months to reasearch and find something I could afford/liked. \n\nI got home to the cutest car accessories today. It's a set of 3 deadpool figurines. I cannot believe my boyfriend remembered a comment I made about a month ago about how cute these action figures were. When I asked what the ocasion for this gift was, my boyfriend shrugged and said \"you were stressed and when these came up on my tiktok shop I had to get them for you\". I cannot believe this man.

We've been inseparable ever since.\n\nToday I was working from home as usual, as I stopped working at that office and received a delivery - a ping pong table - the exact same one we used to play on! He asked to buy it and the CEO gave it to us for free.\n\nJust wanted to share this little happy story of ours.\n\nI love my boyfriend so much, and I'm so happy we found each other.

I\u2019m beyond devastated, I never knew things were so bad with her health. She did immunotherapy for two months over the summer and was in remission. So I thought things were going well. All the hopes and things we wanted to do together are now gone. She\u2019s never coming back and I have to accept that. But it\u2019s just hard, it\u2019s hard because I loved her so much and saw my future with her. And now it\u2019s all gone. Why did she have to leave me here alone. I wish I could\u2019ve said a final goodbye message or call, but I never got that closure either. It\u2019s just all too much for me guys. She had so much life ahead of her and she even said next year was gonna be a good year for her.
