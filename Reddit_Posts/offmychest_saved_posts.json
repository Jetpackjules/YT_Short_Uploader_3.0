I work in retail management and this particular company could not be more awful. Last week I finally decided I was fed up. \n\nAfter a grueling 4 interview process over the last week I was just offered a position at a significantly better company for: \n\nA. $25,000 more per year base salary \nB. 30mins closer to my house \nC. In a much safer area\n\nAfter the most challenging year of my life, I can honestly say this is the win I needed to keep me pushing. I hope everyone has a great weekend, thanks for reading.  ",

I also wasn't sure if she lost it due to medical reasons. So if you're losing a lot of weight in a small amount of time that could be the case.  If she had brought up a diet or eating healthy or exercising then I would've come right in and told her how awesome she looked, but she was super quiet about it so that also made me hesitate.",

I never know what\u2019s going on, maybe they have an eating disorder, or are going through chemo, and I don\u2019t want to put my foot in my mouth by praising them for losing weight.\n\nPlus I had a friend who lost a bunch of weight and everyone told her how great she looked and it made her feel like she must have looked awful before. She unfortunately regained the weight later and those comments made her feel like everyone must secretly be thinking she looks terrible.\n\nAll that to say people may have noticed your weight loss but don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to comment. And that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I did have a coworker who was losing tons of weight and I didn\u2019t say a word. She then mentioned in casual conversation that her doctor had started her on ozempic and she was so happy to be losing weight. I then felt comfortable congratulating her and talking over different clothing styles that might look great on her new frame. So it\u2019s possible that if you open the conversational door that you are doing this safely and are happy with your progress that people will be more comfortable chatting with you about it.\n\nRegardless, congratulations and be proud of what I\u2019m sure was a lot of hard work.

I became more approachable and feel even sexier in my natural face. I believe self-esteem and confidence are two very different things. It sounds like you may be struggling with self-esteem, and feeling pretty gives you confidence. Maybe finding other ways to feel confident could be a good first step.

The fun in life doesn't have to end just because you've reached \"adulthood.\" To many people, you are still a child, so let yourself be one! The hard parts of adulthood will eventually grow to be normal for you, but I understand that it's scary now. I know it seems like it's the end of world but it's not. In fact, there's so much out there for you to still experience! There have so many people I've met and absolutely amazing opportunities/experiences I've had as a young adult that I'm grateful for. All of them are things I only got to experience because I'm an adult, because I grew up a bit. I just wanted to tell you that the things that scare you about starting adulthood won't scare you as much once you've actually lived through it a bit. Life can be very, very hard, yes, but I hope you have friends and family that can help you along the way too when you're struggling, when the fear of the future becomes too much. Have hope for yourself. If things aren't how you expected them to be, the good thing about growing up is that you have more power to change things, to make your life how you see fit. But you only have that power if you let yourself embrace that change. \n\nThere's still so much more to life than all your fears for the future. Let yourself explore, make mistakes, party, and do all the things you want to do. That's what this period of your life is for. \n\nSorry for the long reply but this is something I was actually thinking about recently, as I wrote a \"letter to my past self\" a couple weeks ago.",

Pregnancy;\nYou need to make a decision as a single entity.\nSo questions to consider;\nCan you keep this child?\nHow are your finances? Can you support it? How about emotionally? How big is your village? Will you receive help from friends and family? What are your life goals? Will this baby move you towards or away or neither?\n\nAfter you know where you stand and what you want. Then you can consider having a discussion with your boyfriend. But know always where you stand before an argument/negotiation/decision in your life.\n\nPregnancy always always changes the life of the mother more than the father. Do not underestimate it. \n\n2. Cheating:\nWhere do you stand in cheating? What is the context behind it ?\nSome individuals are black and white and don't tolerate any cheating. Others aren't, and sometimes, albeit rarely it can lead to couples therapy and overall relationship improvement.\n\nWhat do you want? That is the most important thing \nIt is your body and your relationship.\n\nHowever, realistically, it is highly unlikely that your boyfriend will step up for a child when he can't step up for a relationship.\n\nGood luck,",
