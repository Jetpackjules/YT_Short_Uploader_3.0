So I signed up at the local college and learned to sail. Did some competitive racing . I dreamed of racing in the Americas Cup, and sailing around the world, and living on a sail boat. I even built a wooden sailboat, and restored a few. After a number of years and getting caught in some bad storms, and getting tired of waiting for the perfect weather, then getting all rigged up just in time for the wind to die. I realized this sport is anything but peaceful and relaxing. Now I sit on the beach and watch the sailboats go by and think.... Poor saps... They could be lying on the beach relaxing . But there out there yanking on ropes and grinding winches.",

You call the bank rep and they will courier the money to you. \n\n4) family offices. The legal and financial equivalent of a private clinic of your own. One or more lawyers, one or more CPAs, both with the usual staff. Want to buy a property? Just call the office and they will handle all the paperwork.

They will arrange a custom paint colour and guarantee no other car will get that shade. Ditto for upholstery, dash treatment etc. In the middle, the likes of Lamborghini and Koenigsegg have lists of billionaire car collectors. When they come up with a concept, they consult with the members of that list before any metal gets shaped. When they release the latest hyper car and say only 25 will be made, that's because only 25 billionaires said they wanted one. Being able to say you have a 1 of 25 car is valuable over and above the car itself. At the very high end, you can call them and pitch your own concepts and they will build a complete 1 of 1 car for you.

Honestly it reminds me of those horrible scary bridges you've seen over rivers in Siberia or some other place in central Asia. It's loud and bumpy and you can feel the whole thing sway because it gets 25,000 cars crossing it EVERY DAY.\n\nNot only that... you can actually walk under it since there's a river walk pathway it connects to, and you can see  rusted sections just rotting away. About 6 months ago a truck crossed it and a panel on the surface somehow see-sawed up into the gas tank. The truck made it across but not before losing probably 80 to 100 gallons of diesel onto the bridge and into the river below. The river had a marshy / swampy area near the bridge and you could see the fuel slick eddying and collecting into that area. I can't imagine much survived underneath. I'm sure a lot of fish eggs and small aquatic animals died down there.\n\nThe city, state and feds have known this bridge needs replacing for decades and they know about the rust and rot, but they continue to say that it will last for now. Don't they always say that though? \n\nThere is a plan to make a new one next to it... but it won't be done until 2028... which we all know means it'll probably drag on into 2029, 2030, etc.\n\nI honestly don't think it will last that long.",

Some of them are not downloadable, but will link you to places where you can buy them, so no piracy is present here.\n\nEDIT: You absolutely have to give a try to **SAW** and **You Are Empty**. **SAW** is a spinoff game that takes place after SAW 1's ending in an alternative universe where detective Tapp had survived. The controls are weird and the gameplay loop is repetitive, but I think that it's still really cool. **You Are Empty** is practically Half-Life clone, and might be too long for some gamers, but it is absolutely fun and really dynamic, as you never stay too long in one place.",

Skinner is considered the father of \"behaviorism\", and he wrote a sci-fi book called Walden Two which featured some of this.\n\nWhat he's less known for today, but was well-known for back in his day, was his \"Air Crib\" for babies. It was basically a ventilated and climate controlled box enclosed by plexiglass. It was padded but similar to a doctor's chair with paper that rolls out and replaced with new paper. In this case it was rolled out for hygiene (messes, etc.).\n\nAnd parents who bought and used one for their kids \\*loved\\* it because their kids were content and comfortable.\n\nBut the masses and media thought it was crazy. They claimed Skinner was nuts and the Air Crib was basically a \"terrarium\" for children.\n\nSkinner invented it because his research determined that the main reason babies become upset and cry, besides being hungry, is that they are uncomfortably too warm or too cold. His research showed that if a baby has a perfectly controlled environment and is comfortable, it won't keep waking up at night crying... and parents will get more sleep. Plus, since you didn't need blankets and sheets, nor did the baby need all sorts of clothing to wear, parents didn't have to constantly do laundry.\n\nAgain, critics ridiculed the Air Crib, claiming that it was a horrible \"Skinner Box\" (which was a totally different thing he used for experiments). They even invented stories about babies dying or growing up crazy, and that Skinner's own daughter ended up committing suicide as a result of her being raised in an Air Crib. Which is funny because Skinner's daughter would later claim that she was very healthy and alive and had no horrible memories of the Air Crib.\n\nUltimately, the thing that's interesting about the Air Crib is that it's really just a technological upgrade from the very thing most Finns put their babies in. When a woman in Finland gives birth, they are literally handed a folded up cardboard box and when they get home they unfold it, put a little padding at the bottom, and that's it. No fancy elaborate crib. A cardboard box.\n\nThe Finns have one of the lowest infant mortality rates on the planet: 2.1 per 1000 born. By comparison the United States, Slovakia, United Arab Emirates and Bosnia have the nearly the exact same rate: around 5 to 5.1\n\nYou can't really buy an Air Crib anymore because no company is willing to associate itself with the constant criticism of the device, regardless of how successful it was to numerous couples in the 1940s and '50s, but [you can build one yourself](https://www.gearability.com/2007/04/building-a-skinner-air-crib/).",

                "text": "A guy I worked with had a long distance relationship with this girl he'd yet to meet in person. Then suddenly she tells him she can fly and meet him in a month.\n\nAt the time he [lived.in](http://lived.in) the basement of his folks place. Not something he had declared earlier in their chats.\n\nIn a panic he got a new apartment.\n\nThen he went to one of those furniture rental places and rented an entire apartment's worth of furniture. Couch, tables, dinet set, bedroom suite, TV..etc\n\nThe whole fkn apartment was rental furniture which if you don't know, gets expensive really quickly.\n\nSo after all this the girl finally shows up. They go to his apartment and that's when she tells him that they should break up.\n\nShe didn't want to do it over text and without meeting him at least once. She thought it wouldn't be fair to him.\n\nShe stayed one night and got on the plane the next day. Apparently her stop in our city was just an extended layover as she was heading to Europe to tour with friends.\n\nShe slept in the rental bed and he slept on the rental couch. Then next day he drove her to the airport in his rental car.\n\nI don't know how many thousands he dropped for that one breakup date but man...what a waste.\n\n\n\n**Edits:**\n\nA couple of things to clarify some common questions.\n\n1. why not airbnb? This was 2004 or 2005. Airbnb didn't exist.\n2. why not a hotel? He had told her that he had his own place for quite a while. Something like a year or so. A hotel wouldn't have cut it.\n3. why not a furnished apartment? They're pretty rare in our city and the ones that do exist are for seniors or 50+.\n4. why did she fly there.just to break up with him? She did and she didn't on this one. The way he told it is that she was on her way to Europe to do a bus tour with friends and the route she took with her flights to get there brought her through our city. So she arranged an extended layover so she  could meet him and break the news gently instead of doing it by text or email.\n5. why did she get the bed and he got the couch? What a loser!    Not true. She offered to take the couch but he refused. My coworker was really tall too, like 6ft 8in tall. So he painted the story of his legs being draped over the armrest. She really insisted he took the bed but he told us he felt chivalrous to take the couch instead.",

By my own diagnosis she seems a lost in terms of what to do now. Her most recent singles seem like they're trying to recapture the energy of Teenage Dream but that was 14 years ago and times have changed. They are also worse than anything from that era.

She kept pressing about the charges, what they were, and I had to explain to her that LavaLife is a dating service and that the charges were legitimate. If she didn't make them, did someone else live in her house who might have? There was only her husband, and I heard her go from '...But he would never...' to 'I have to go now' as it set in.\u00a0\n\n\nThat was almost 20 years ago now and I still feel awful about it.\u00a0",

Coaching, giving him legitimate \u201cchecklist\u201d instructions, having a team lead sit with him for a couple weeks to walk him through basics, everything. \n\nEveryone said the same thing. He just\u2026couldn\u2019t do the job. Everything he did had to be double checked by somebody else, which meant that we might as well have somebody else do it. \n\nBut everyone liked the guy - they thought he was easy going and cool to be around, everything. But still he just straight up couldn\u2019t do that job. So I had to find another place for him in the company that would better match his skills. The option would be for him to either take the lower job with lower pay, or he would be fired, with severance. I was not looking forward to the conversation.\n\nI called him in for a 1-1 to break it to him and the first thing he started with was \u201chey boss, before we start I just want to tell you that I really feel like I\u2019ve been doing a great job here and I would like to talk about a raise.\u201d\n\nYeah, that conversation was not a fun one.",

One of them loved to take a full week off work during holidays, to get more bang for his pto buck. \n\nOne year, he had Thanksgiving week off, but the other supervisor had family come to town that week on late notice.  The other supervisor asked him to cancel just one of his days so she could spend the day with family.  He declined, even after she basically begged him, and he even said he didn't have anything to do that day...\n\nShe then proceeded to take pto days every Wednesday of a holiday week for the next calendar year, effectively blocking him from taking his cheap weeks off. \n\nHe told me that he thought it was funny because he knew she didn't have enough time to take all those vacation days off, and she'd eventually have to cancel some of them.  I got to tell him, \"I hate to break it to you, but she only took 2 hours off each of those days.\"  See, the rule didn't differentiate between a partial or whole day, so she only had to burn 24 or so hours to block him.  He looked devastated. \n\nIt was kind of petty on both of their parts, but I give her credit for being creative in her retribution and don't blame her a bit for what she did.",

He was to give this NSA technician access to a cable substation for him to perform some work. The tech did his thing and Mark moved on without thinking anything of it.\n\nA year later in 2003, Mark was transferred to that cable substation and by chance was assigned to monitor the \u201cInternet Room\u201d. This was the room where all the fiber optic ocean cables that carry the countries internet traffic terminate. While he was reviewing engineering drawings, he realized that the schematics revealed a secret room. More importantly, the plans showed cabinets filled with fiber optic splitters coming off every cable and feeding into the secret room. And to make it even crazier, neither he nor anyone on his team had access to the secret room.\n\nThrough his investigation, he discovered that the NSA representative he had escorted the previous year had worked to install this system which was sending a copy of all the internet traffic that passed through the substation straight to the NSA. In other words, he had proof that the federal government had the capacity to tap into all internet traffic in the country. And I mean all of it. Every email, instant message, electronic sale, medical or criminal records, research databases. Everything. Complete unrestricted access.\n\nLike any sane person, he was extremely disturbed by this discovery. He went to his higher ups but was essentially told to just keep it quiet. After retiring in 2004, he linked up with a group called Electronic Frontier Foundation and essentially blew the whistle. He did interviews and handed over all his evidence to reporters. \n\nI watched one of these interviews in 2006 which is how I know about this story. I remember thinking it was so obvious once he explained it. Why wouldn\u2019t the NSA tap into the internet traffic in the age of the war on terror? I\u2019d watched Enemy of the State. But nothing happened. No one I spoke to seemed to believe it and Mark Klein\u2019s story eventually seemed to just fade away.\n\n7 years later, in 2013, Edward Snowden leaked documents essentially confirming EVERYTHING and then some. But to this day everyone looks at me like a crazy person when I talk about knowing about it as early as 2006.",

Formula needed to be mixed with water but because they often didn't have clean water, they'd put their babies at risk mixing the formula with unclean water. Also, literacy rates were lower in a lot of those places so the mothers didn't know how to clean the bottles and couldn't read the instructions on the packaging. Those that did often didn't have the means to carry them out. A lot of them being poorer also resorted to watering down the formula to try and make it last longer but then it wouldn't have enough nutrients for the baby.\n\nNestle downplayed all of this and said it wasn't their responsibility that people here didn't really have access to clean water and that they were just giving people the freedom of choice.",
