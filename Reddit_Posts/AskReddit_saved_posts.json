However, he wrote letters to them every week. He respected that they didn\u2019t want to talk to him but refused to accept that they never wanted to hear from him again (he was stubborn). So he thought about it long and hard and spoke with my grandmother about it. \n\nThey agreed that letters would work. It came in the mail and then if they wanted to read it, they could, if they didn\u2019t, they could toss it out. No harm no foul. But they would know he thought of them every time they threw one away. After 12 years, the kids called him, and he told them he wouldn\u2019t be the one to call first because they said not to and until they said otherwise, they\u2019d have to call him. \n\nEventually everything was rebuilt and it was fine, but it was one time where I saw someone get it right.",

It's loud and bumpy and you can feel the whole thing sway because it gets 25,000 cars crossing it EVERY DAY.\n\nNot only that... you can actually walk under it since there's a river walk pathway it connects to, and you can see  rusted sections just rotting away. About 6 months ago a truck crossed it and a panel on the surface somehow see-sawed up into the gas tank. The truck made it across but not before losing probably 80 to 100 gallons of diesel onto the bridge and into the river below. The river had a marshy / swampy area near the bridge and you could see the fuel slick eddying and collecting into that area. I can't imagine much survived underneath. I'm sure a lot of fish eggs and small aquatic animals died down there.\n\nThe city, state and feds have known this bridge needs replacing for decades and they know about the rust and rot, but they continue to say that it will last for now. Don't they always say that though? \n\nThere is a plan to make a new one next to it... but it won't be done until 2028... which we all know means it'll probably drag on into 2029, 2030, etc.\n\nI honestly don't think it will last that long.",

How could I have miscalculated my direction so? It\u2019s a dangerous mistake at any time for a diver, much more so at night. \n\nBut as I was ascending, the brightness of the light really irked me.

The water was so clear and calm, I had mistaken it for a light. \n\nLuckily I hadn\u2019t ascended fully and wasn\u2019t too far off.

                "text": "B.F. Skinner's \"Air Crib\"\n\nIn psychology B.F. Skinner is considered the father of \"behaviorism\", and he wrote a sci-fi book called Walden Two which featured some of this.\n\nWhat he's less known for today, but was well-known for back in his day, was his \"Air Crib\" for babies. It was basically a ventilated and climate controlled box enclosed by plexiglass. It was padded but similar to a doctor's chair with paper that rolls out and replaced with new paper. In this case it was rolled out for hygiene (messes, etc.).\n\nAnd parents who bought and used one for their kids \\*loved\\* it because their kids were content and comfortable.\n\nBut the masses and media thought it was crazy. They claimed Skinner was nuts and the Air Crib was basically a \"terrarium\" for children.\n\nSkinner invented it because his research determined that the main reason babies become upset and cry, besides being hungry, is that they are uncomfortably too warm or too cold. His research showed that if a baby has a perfectly controlled environment and is comfortable, it won't keep waking up at night crying... and parents will get more sleep. Plus, since you didn't need blankets and sheets, nor did the baby need all sorts of clothing to wear, parents didn't have to constantly do laundry.\n\nAgain, critics ridiculed the Air Crib, claiming that it was a horrible \"Skinner Box\" (which was a totally different thing he used for experiments). They even invented stories about babies dying or growing up crazy, and that Skinner's own daughter ended up committing suicide as a result of her being raised in an Air Crib. Which is funny because Skinner's daughter would later claim that she was very healthy and alive and had no horrible memories of the Air Crib.\n\nUltimately, the thing that's interesting about the Air Crib is that it's really just a technological upgrade from the very thing most Finns put their babies in. When a woman in Finland gives birth, they are literally handed a folded up cardboard box and when they get home they unfold it, put a little padding at the bottom, and that's it. No fancy elaborate crib. A cardboard box.\n\nThe Finns have one of the lowest infant mortality rates on the planet: 2.1 per 1000 born. By comparison the United States, Slovakia, United Arab Emirates and Bosnia have the nearly the exact same rate: around 5 to 5.1\n\nYou can't really buy an Air Crib anymore because no company is willing to associate itself with the constant criticism of the device, regardless of how successful it was to numerous couples in the 1940s and '50s, but [you can build one yourself](https://www.gearability.com/2007/04/building-a-skinner-air-crib/).",

Not something he had declared earlier in their chats.\n\nIn a panic he got a new apartment.\n\nThen he went to one of those furniture rental places and rented an entire apartment's worth of furniture. Couch, tables, dinet set, bedroom suite, TV..etc\n\nThe whole fkn apartment was rental furniture which if you don't know, gets expensive really quickly.\n\nSo after all this the girl finally shows up. They go to his apartment and that's when she tells him that they should break up.\n\nShe didn't want to do it over text and without meeting him at least once. She thought it wouldn't be fair to him.\n\nShe stayed one night and got on the plane the next day. Apparently her stop in our city was just an extended layover as she was heading to Europe to tour with friends.\n\nShe slept in the rental bed and he slept on the rental couch. Then next day he drove her to the airport in his rental car.\n\nI don't know how many thousands he dropped for that one breakup date but man...what a waste.\n\n\n\n**Edits:**\n\nA couple of things to clarify some common questions.\n\n1. why not airbnb? This was 2004 or 2005. Airbnb didn't exist.\n2. why not a hotel? He had told her that he had his own place for quite a while. Something like a year or so. A hotel wouldn't have cut it.\n3. why not a furnished apartment? They're pretty rare in our city and the ones that do exist are for seniors or 50+.\n4. why did she fly there.just to break up with him? She did and she didn't on this one. The way he told it is that she was on her way to Europe to do a bus tour with friends and the route she took with her flights to get there brought her through our city. So she arranged an extended layover so she  could meet him and break the news gently instead of doing it by text or email.\n5. why did she get the bed and he got the couch? What a loser!    Not true. She offered to take the couch but he refused. My coworker was really tall too, like 6ft 8in tall. So he painted the story of his legs being draped over the armrest.

He graduated with honors and made six figures out of college. He\u2019s since gotten married and made a life for himself in our hometown.

I was 13 years old, overweight, sick all the time, prone to violent outbursts (mimicking my biological father), and actively researching the most painless and foolproof methods for ending my life.\n\nI started running. At first, I could only make it a couple of hundred feet. My ankles felt like they'd burst into flames. But I leaned into the pain, because it felt like something other than despair. I kept running. Within a year, I was fit, swore off violence, and found several compelling reasons to live. And I got hopped up on bananas and Diet Coke and ran 13 miles one afternoon like it was nothing.\n\nI've fallen back into the pit several times in my life, but I always claw my way out toward the light. Running has always been the fulcrum. I'd be dead without it.",

He was to give this NSA technician access to a cable substation for him to perform some work. The tech did his thing and Mark moved on without thinking anything of it.\n\nA year later in 2003, Mark was transferred to that cable substation and by chance was assigned to monitor the \u201cInternet Room\u201d. This was the room where all the fiber optic ocean cables that carry the countries internet traffic terminate. While he was reviewing engineering drawings, he realized that the schematics revealed a secret room. More importantly, the plans showed cabinets filled with fiber optic splitters coming off every cable and feeding into the secret room. And to make it even crazier, neither he nor anyone on his team had access to the secret room.\n\nThrough his investigation, he discovered that the NSA representative he had escorted the previous year had worked to install this system which was sending a copy of all the internet traffic that passed through the substation straight to the NSA. In other words, he had proof that the federal government had the capacity to tap into all internet traffic in the country. And I mean all of it. Every email, instant message, electronic sale, medical or criminal records, research databases. Everything. Complete unrestricted access.\n\nLike any sane person, he was extremely disturbed by this discovery. He went to his higher ups but was essentially told to just keep it quiet. After retiring in 2004, he linked up with a group called Electronic Frontier Foundation and essentially blew the whistle. He did interviews and handed over all his evidence to reporters. \n\nI watched one of these interviews in 2006 which is how I know about this story. I remember thinking it was so obvious once he explained it. Why wouldn\u2019t the NSA tap into the internet traffic in the age of the war on terror? I\u2019d watched Enemy of the State. But nothing happened. No one I spoke to seemed to believe it and Mark Klein\u2019s story eventually seemed to just fade away.\n\n7 years later, in 2013, Edward Snowden leaked documents essentially confirming EVERYTHING and then some. But to this day everyone looks at me like a crazy person when I talk about knowing about it as early as 2006.",

Formula needed to be mixed with water but because they often didn't have clean water, they'd put their babies at risk mixing the formula with unclean water. Also, literacy rates were lower in a lot of those places so the mothers didn't know how to clean the bottles and couldn't read the instructions on the packaging. Those that did often didn't have the means to carry them out. A lot of them being poorer also resorted to watering down the formula to try and make it last longer but then it wouldn't have enough nutrients for the baby.\n\nNestle downplayed all of this and said it wasn't their responsibility that people here didn't really have access to clean water and that they were just giving people the freedom of choice.",

I was with a buddy walking along the pier when I see this gorgeous three master sitting up ahead. I want to go look at it, and see it's flying a Norwegian flag. I get closer and start taking with one of the girls on the ship. She says they're college students and this is sort of an foreign study credit, sailing the ship. From Bergen all the way around to South America. That sounds amazing. \n\nAs I'm looking around, I notice that the ship is called the Heyerdahl. I comment that I wrote papers on Thor and got my degrees based on my admiration. She asked if I ever met him, and I just laughed...I was a poor kid from Western South Dakota... What were the chances I'd ever get to meet him? \n\nShe said he was right over at a cafe less than a block away. \n\nI remember with unbelievable clarity. He was sitting on a little white bench outside the place with a disposable cup of something, with a book in his hand. There was a small table and chair not far away, and I could only just sit and look. \n\nHe looks up about a minute or two later, sees me and says, \"I'm sorry, but are you alright?\" I didn't even realize I was crying. \n\nOver the next hour and a half I talked and listened to him, watched him smile and talk about how adventure still existed, you just had to find them, and live them whenever you could. \n\nHe invited me to visit him if I was ever in Norway, and we both laughed at that. \n\nWhen he died in '02, I bawled my eyes out. \n\nI live in Atlanta now, and a little over a year ago my wife and I went to Charleston for a few days. After dinner one evening we were walking along the pier and I saw where the ship had been tied up. Nothing there at that moment.

During the 90's we'd occasionally see a F-117 or B-2 flying during the day. \n\nBut one night in 09 or 10 I was hanging out on the shore of a lake doing teenage things and heard something weird. I was along a flight path and nearish to the aforementioned airbase so I was used to planes and helicopters flying past. I'm familiar with what Chinooks and MH60'S sound like but this was different, something was off. \n\nThat's when I saw two helicopters with normal lights break through the tree line, I assume apache but it was dark and I'm just guessing there. However between them was a third helicopter with no lights at all. Almost like the other two were escorting it. \n\nI know it's incrediblely rare for any aircraft to be granted permission to fly with no lights. And again it sounded weird I could differentiate between the normal \"thwump thwump\" of the two escorts and the mysterious third craft that had a much more muffled \"thwip thwip\".\n\nAnyways in 2011 seal team six crashed one of their modified stealth helicopters during the Bin Laden raid and they had to acknowledge that the Comanche program wasn't as dead as we were lead to believe.

His wife was with him, cant remember her name but her nickname was Lady. Also 2 of their 3 kids were in the car, unfortunately no-one survived.

In most other countries, you can't advertise prescription drugs, especially those with egregious side effects that may, in fact, include death. In my country, you have OTC drugs like cold and headache drugs being advertised, or basic supplements. This wasn't a comment about the death part - just the extent of healthcare corporatization that allows prescription meds to be promoted like candy.\n\nEDIT 2: Also, the question was about the weirdest thing that's normal in America, so I'm going with the above. That said, many comments are talking about how friendly Americans are, and I completely agree. It's just that while that was surprising, it was a pleasant, lovely surprise - not weird.

It just didn't come up and we were more interested in each other than worrying about all that.\n\nThen, I guess sometime around 2016, Obama's name was brought up. Not even a judgement call, more of a \"he exists\" kind of thing. Well she then gives me a \"Ugh, Obama.... that terrorist.\"\n\nexcuse me?\n\n\"Yeah, his middle name is Hussein, he's a terrorist.\"\n\nand then from then on we just COULD not have a conversation that didn't devolve into an argument. And so so many of our arguments ended with her going \"well the bible says _____, so....\"\n\nThings finally came to a head when she started fishing around the idea of marriage. Now, we were arguing practically every convo so obviously I wasn't feeling that. So it came down to me saying I wouldn't consider marriage until we live together and she wouldn't consider living together unless we were married. At that impasse we decided to break it off. She then went off the Alt-Right deep end so it was probably for the best.\n\nSo now, I tend towards finding out someone's politics and religious beliefs way earlier than most say is normal.

Car guys are on a never ending quest for more power and a cheap way to make power is with a less restrictive exhaust. Especially on turbocharged vehicles like I own. Actually, the loudness of the exhaust is just a byproduct of decreasing restriction and not always the intention. \n\nWhy other car people do it: Because they like the sound and it's their vehicle and they get enjoyment out of listening to the engine roar. \n\nWhy the last group does it: Because they can't afford to (or don't care to) fix their old-broken exhaust.",

It became increasingly apparent during planning and training for his second mission, Soyuz-1, that it was terribly flawed at every level, but all official protests fell on deaf ears because of the bureaucratic culture of the program and the Kremlin. The whole thing had an air of doom but he knew if he backed out, apart from all other consequences, his close friend (and Soviet hero) Yuri Gagarin would be compelled to take his place.\n\nThe launch was a success, but after achieving orbit the solar sail failed to properly deploy, leaving several crucial systems unpowered and obscuring transmission from communications and navigation equipment. He wrestled with the craft trying to get it manually oriented for five hours and , through skillful piloting, partially succeeded, but failing thrusters and bad weather conditions caused mission control to scuttle a companion launch that was intended to aid him, and to abort his mission. \n\nHe had to stay up orbiting earth 18 times without proper guidance systems, acting as a human computer and gyroscope to get it into a proper reentry window despite the unresponsive thrusters, but he eventually succeeded. He was in radio contact with Gagarin assuring him conditions were good. It looked like he may actually make it... and then the primary chute failed to deploy. And then the secondary chute got tangled in the primary chute. THEN the retro rockets failed to fire on ground approach-- which would have been right before he hit the Earth at 90mph. Some reports have him transmitting screams of rage on the way down.\n\n***\nIn a similar vein, I was literally nauseous with horror when I first found out that NASA covered up the fact that the Challenger accident wasn't immediately fatal and that several of the astronauts were very likely alive and conscious as their capsule rocketed off and then plunged into the sea.",

It was the day after Christmas, and it was chilly outside, so we got to bed early to wake up for hunting. In the middle of the night, my Dad wakes up and starts screaming like he's being attacked. He then immediately began sobbing. This is the only time I've seen or heard my father cry. When he calmed down, his terrified sons asked what happened. He said he'd had a terrible nightmare about an endless surge of water that was sweeping families away and drowning children. I recall he said those words specifically. To have my Dad tell me about a dream was strange in and of itself. You must understand all of this was completely out of character. Finally, I asked if we drowned in his dream because, at this point, I was sure there was some meaning to this vision. He said no and that all of the people looked Chinese. Now let me preface by saying we did not have internet access on our cell phones at this time, and we did not have any access to TV or news at our hunting property.

I got up to see if she was OK, and as I walked past the TV it went off channel to static. My cat wanted out badly, and I went out with her! The TV went back to normal and chastising myself I opened the door to go back in, and as I took one step in the TV went back to static. I stayed outside with my cat until she calmed down, and nothing like that ever happened again. I still think about it sometimes.",

There\u2019s a sign: St. Vincent. A few of the things immediately  noticeable were a shop called Webster Welding, an old fashioned horse drawn water pump for fire fighting, several large poplars with dead tops, and black and white painted rocks along the street that faced the highway. I kept watching in the rear view mirror and it stayed visible. I drive a few miles and there is a gentleman waving at me from beside his car. He\u2019s obviously broken down and I pulled over. A quick chat and I learn he\u2019s blown a tire and wrecked his rim. He asks if I\u2019ll drive him back to the town. No problem. In he gets and off we go. The town is not there. It\u2019s a dusty Alberta crossroad. This fellow and I just sat in my truck in silence. I raised an arm and my hair was standing on end. His too. He said \u201cAll the trees were dead. Are we dead?\u201d  Eventually I drove him to a nearby town. He simply got out of the truck and walked away. \nI remember it like it was yesterday. I could tell you what that town looked like in perfect detail.",

                "text": "I\u2019ve told other unexplained stories on Reddit but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve told the one about the thing my friend and I saw on the side of the road. I\u2019ll try and remember it to the best of my ability, it was about 12 ish years ago. If anyone else saw something similar let me know. \n\nIt\u2019s around 3 in the morning in rural North-Central Alberta. My friend and I are driving home from a high school party in which neither of us drank or took any drugs. It\u2019s the middle of winter. In Alberta, this means it\u2019s *cold* outside. This night it was below -30 degrees Celsius (below -22 degrees Fahrenheit; edited to fix temperature). \n\nThe whole way home, my friend and I are chatting about the usual things: what happened at the party, the boys we liked, etc. While most teenage girls are chatty, this friend in particular was a chatter box. Mostly I would listen and just react to whatever she said (love friends like that). So, because she would do most of the talking and didn\u2019t require much input, I\u2019d zone out sometimes looking out the window. \n\nWe are about 5-7 minutes outside of town at this point taking the highway, probably going 75-90 km/hour. Using an online calculator that puts us around 6-7ish km outside of town in a sparsely wooded area with no services open in town.\n\nAs we round a corner, I\u2019m zoning out listening to my friend talk, when through the windshield, I notice glowing eyes off the side of the road, the headlights not fully hitting whatever it was. The eyes were green/yellowish. This would be normal but these eyes are about 7-8 feet above the ground. At first, I think it\u2019s a hiker or someone walking back to town, but their eyes wouldn\u2019t glow and no one is going to be walking that far from town or any houses when it\u2019s *that* cold and late outside (this was a town of less than 1000 ppl). \n\nAs we drive closer, this thing appears to have goat-like legs, is very heavy set, and stands on two feet. Its arms drop down by its side like a person\u2019s and it appears to even have some kind of dark clothing on the top half. It had something like goat-like horns that curved but went upwards. At this point, my blood runs completely cold and I have a full-fledged instinctual freeze response, hairs standing up on the back of my neck. I remember hearing my own disembodied voice think \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be seeing this. This is wrong.\u201d I even teared up. We pass by it relatively quickly and I can\u2019t stop thinking about what that was. \n\n My perception of time was kind of weird after that due to panic. But now the lights of town are in front of us, and I realize my friend isn\u2019t talking anymore. I turn to my friend and sheepishly said with tears still in my eyes, \u201csorry, what were you saying? I must be going crazy but I thought I saw something back there.\u201d \n\nShe said \u201cno, no it\u2019s fine. I saw it too. Did it kind of look like a goat?\u201d So, she saw it too. We had no idea what it was. We both come from hunting families and I know the easiest critique is that it was an elk or moose standing on hind legs. But the arms of an elk or deer don\u2019t just fall beside the body, they buckle outwards a bit. Regardless, it seemed human-like in its stance and it was very heavy set. Then, you\u2019d think, oh it was a bear. But it had horns and curved back legs. I assume moose would be the same as an elk or deer but I\u2019ve never really seen a moose standing ambiently, typically just when they fight. \n\nEven our responses were odd. You\u2019d think, given scary movies, you\u2019d immediately flip out and react. Both of us kind of just got entranced and terrified for awhile, blood running cold. While the friend and I don\u2019t talk anymore, we talked about it a few times in the next years we were still in contact. She continued to refer to it as the goat thing.",

I live alone in my apartment and I\u2019m a horror gaming fan and thus I was scouring Steam looking for a cool horror game. I put on my headphones and I watched multiple trailers and eventually came to a game called \u2018horror in da hood\u2019. Looked at the page and watched the trailer - here is where the creepy part begins.. Near the end of the trailer there\u2019s a very creepy voice saying something like \u201cCan you help me please?\u201d. One second, literally one second after I watched it I could clearly hear (from outside my headphones so it was muffled) an old male voice saying \u201cI can help haha\u201d from my hallway behind me. Especially the laugh was creepy. Needless to say I through off my headphone and immediately looked behind me, only to be greeted by the dark hallway. I stared into it, slowly grabbing my ruler that was on my desk. After moments that felt like an eternity I was able to stand up. Slowly moved towards the hallway while grabbing a tiny flashlight I have on my nightstand. I flashed the hallway from a distance but there was nothing. To give light to the hallway I have to go into it and turn the switch there, which was very creepy to do. Of course, there was nothing there at all, but it creeps me out still. I left the light on everywhere that night and still keep on the light in the hallway when I am on my computer now. Two days after this happened I went back to watch the horror in da hood trailer to make sure that the \u201cI can help haha\u201d was not in the trailer and I just made a mistake\u2026 it\u2019s not in the trailer.

Her soon to be ex-husband was sending her threatening text messages from burner phones, he was coming by all hours of the night and breaking windows, and a few times attempted to set their house on fire. A friend of hers reached out to me and explained the situation and asked if I could help her in any way. \n\nI purchased cameras and an NVR and went over one night in February and installed the whole system, wires and all. I never felt scared during any of my installations, some of which were in really bad neighborhoods, but this psycho had me worried, so I did this job armed. After finishing up, I showed her how the system works and told her to call me if she ever needed anything else. \n\nA couple weeks later I get a call from a fire investigator asking me for help in recovering  video. He told me that the guy had returned, broke out a first floor window, and threw in a Molotov Cocktail causing the first floor of the house to be engulfed in flames. The woman and her two daughters were trapped upstairs. The police showed before the fire department, and they had to grab an extension ladder from a neighbors house and rescue the family through a second floor window. One of the girls was taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation. \n\nI walked the guy through the process of pulling up the video. Once he got to the right time on the camera facing the bathroom window he said, \u201cThe video just goes blank.\u201d I told him that I set the video cameras to be super sensitive to movement, so the only way it can go blank is if the camera is removed or damaged in some way. I directed him to a camera that would cover the area under the camera that goes blank and he should see someone mess with it. He tells me that nobody ever approached it. I then informed him that the only way that this scenario is possible is if the guy got into the house and disconnected the feed from inside. \n\nWe concluded our conversation since he would now need to pour through a lot of video in order to find this man going into the house. About a month passes by and I am driving to work. I hear the woman\u2019s name who I had been helping mentioned on the radio during a news segment. I start paying attention and soon find myself feeling weightless in my chair. It had not been her husband at all; she had been the one doing all these things in order to get her husband arrested and sent to jail. \n\nShe had bought burner phones to send herself text messages. She had been going out at night and breaking the windows. She had been taking the family out to dinner, excusing herself to go to the restroom, then driving home to break a window and try to set the house on fire before returning to the restaurant. She had been the one to disconnect the camera from inside the house the night that she almost killed her kids in an attempt to frame her husband. I thought I was protecting her from a psycho, but turns out I was helping the psycho. \n\nTLDR: I thought I was helping a \u201cvictim\u201d by protecting her from her soon to be ex husband, but she was trying to frame him by risking her kids lives.",

Socializing and making friends becomes harder as you get older, especially if your life revolves around going out to bars and hanging out. I hit 40 and my body just doesn't want to do that anymore. Having hobbies that don't center around drinking goes a long way.\n\n2. If you haven't learned how to budget money and put aside some for retirement, you're going to be working late into your life. Start early and save yourself the heartache.\n\n3. Protect your hearing. if you're going out to shows and cranking up the volume on your headphones you're going to have a hard time hearing in your 40s and 50s.\n\n4. Travel, especially outdoors travel, becomes harder. I do a lot of hiking and backpacking, and trips I used to think about in my 20s aren't trips I can do now. You also start having more obligations around family and kids so getting time to get away becomes harder. Do it now :)",
