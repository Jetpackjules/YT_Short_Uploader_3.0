However, after the first days of just complete shock, I felt incredibly free. His decision forced me to give up on the idea that somewhere deep inside of him he still had a resemblance of the man I fell in love with.\n\n- I did of course let him know that his comment really hurt my feelings. He just doubled down on why he felt that way and why he had a right to tell me.\n\n- Only afterwards did I realize the kind of abuse this man put me through. It is almost impossible to recognize it while you\u2019re in the midst of it, especially when it escalates so gradually.\n\n- To everyone replying with your kind comments: thank you so much! It has been just over a year and I am indeed thriving now :) And he definitely is not.\n\n- To everyone who is in a similar situation: it may seem overwhelming and impossible to get out. It may feel like it\u2019ll be the hardest thing you\u2019ll ever do. Just know that it will NEVER be harder than staying.",

There was additional faffing about with German companies over import taxes and such that caused us a shortage of other materials. All sorted now, but it was a tense few months. \n\n\n- At the university lab, in addition to above difficulties with suppliers, getting kicked out of the EUs Horizons program lopped a huge amount of funding out from British science. Numbers of EU students have also dropped, so now because of the drop in funding  our financial department is cracking down hard. \nThis leads to ridiculous situations like having to go get 3 alternative quotes for a piece of machinery that is only manufactured by a single company, even when your grant is specifically for that machine.",
