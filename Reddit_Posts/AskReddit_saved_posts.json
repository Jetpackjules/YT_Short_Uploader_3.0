However, after the first days of just complete shock, I felt incredibly free. His decision forced me to give up on the idea that somewhere deep inside of him he still had a resemblance of the man I fell in love with.\n\n- I did of course let him know that his comment really hurt my feelings. He just doubled down on why he felt that way and why he had a right to tell me.\n\n- Only afterwards did I realize the kind of abuse this man put me through. It is almost impossible to recognize it while you\u2019re in the midst of it, especially when it escalates so gradually.\n\n- To everyone replying with your kind comments: thank you so much! It has been just over a year and I am indeed thriving now :) And he definitely is not.\n\n- To everyone who is in a similar situation: it may seem overwhelming and impossible to get out. It may feel like it\u2019ll be the hardest thing you\u2019ll ever do. Just know that it will NEVER be harder than staying.",

There was additional faffing about with German companies over import taxes and such that caused us a shortage of other materials. All sorted now, but it was a tense few months. \n\n\n- At the university lab, in addition to above difficulties with suppliers, getting kicked out of the EUs Horizons program lopped a huge amount of funding out from British science. Numbers of EU students have also dropped, so now because of the drop in funding  our financial department is cracking down hard. \nThis leads to ridiculous situations like having to go get 3 alternative quotes for a piece of machinery that is only manufactured by a single company, even when your grant is specifically for that machine.",

Your doctor will make house calls and even diagnose and prescribe over the phone. \n\n2) concierge banking. You don't go to the bank to withdraw cash on the rare times you need cash. You call the bank rep and they will courier the money to you. \n\n4) family offices. The legal and financial equivalent of a private clinic of your own. One or more lawyers, one or more CPAs, both with the usual staff. Want to buy a property? Just call the office and they will handle all the paperwork. Even spin up a numbered Delaware company and sign deeds for you.\n\n5) bespoke cars. At the lower end, this means you sit down with a Rolls Royce rep and going over choices. They will arrange a custom paint colour and guarantee no other car will get that shade. Ditto for upholstery, dash treatment etc. In the middle, the likes of Lamborghini and Koenigsegg have lists of billionaire car collectors. When they come up with a concept, they consult with the members of that list before any metal gets shaped. When they release the latest hyper car and say only 25 will be made, that's because only 25 billionaires said they wanted one. Being able to say you have a 1 of 25 car is valuable over and above the car itself. At the very high end, you can call them and pitch your own concepts and they will build a complete 1 of 1 car for you. The Sultan of Brunei famously had a lot of total one off cars made to his exact specifications from many different manufacturers. The \"Rainbow Sheikh\" Sheikh Hamad bin Hamdan Al Nahyan has also done this numerous times.",

Honestly it reminds me of those horrible scary bridges you've seen over rivers in Siberia or some other place in central Asia. It's loud and bumpy and you can feel the whole thing sway because it gets 25,000 cars crossing it EVERY DAY.\n\nNot only that... you can actually walk under it since there's a river walk pathway it connects to, and you can see  rusted sections just rotting away. About 6 months ago a truck crossed it and a panel on the surface somehow see-sawed up into the gas tank. The truck made it across but not before losing probably 80 to 100 gallons of diesel onto the bridge and into the river below. The river had a marshy / swampy area near the bridge and you could see the fuel slick eddying and collecting into that area. I can't imagine much survived underneath. I'm sure a lot of fish eggs and small aquatic animals died down there.\n\nThe city, state and feds have known this bridge needs replacing for decades and they know about the rust and rot, but they continue to say that it will last for now. Don't they always say that though? \n\nThere is a plan to make a new one next to it... but it won't be done until 2028... which we all know means it'll probably drag on into 2029, 2030, etc.\n\nI honestly don't think it will last that long.",
