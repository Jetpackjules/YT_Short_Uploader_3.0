We couldn\u2019t drive yet so we asked her dad to take us (the theater was 30 mins away). He said yes but her mother was adamant that my father should come pick us up from the theater after it was over. She was very insistent that she wanted my dad to come get us and felt her husband shouldn\u2019t have to go out twice.\n\nFair enough I thought, so I called my dad and asked him if he could pick us up from the movies and bring us back to my friend\u2019s house after. Sure, he said, and I told my friend\u2019s mom this. (My friend was a witness to all of this). She seemed pleased that my dad was coming to pick us up. \n\nAfter the movies, my dad picks us up and takes us back to my friend\u2019s house. When we walk in, her mother starts asking where her husband is? My friend is like \u201cI don\u2019t know, we just got back from the movies what do you mean?\u201d The mom starts saying that her husband went out to go get us from the movie theater. My friend and I were so puzzled and reminded her that she had wanted my dad to pick us up and told her that he was going to so he did. \n\nShe starts flipping out, insisting that that never happened, and screaming at us. She was acting scarily insane. My friend was trying to reason with her but it was getting no where. My friend was so embarrassed and felt so bad but I knew I had to get out of there. \n\nI immediately called my dad and asked him to turn around and come pick me up. Stayed in my own house for another week without any power after that. Better being without power than being around that crazy lady. And I never went over there again.\n\nTo this day I still don\u2019t get what happened there\u2026",

He also had no furniture inside his house and had a brand new shiny grand piano in the kitchen because the rest of the house was FULL of these giant crystal geodes that were probably worth a fortune and cardboard boxes everywhere. \n\nHis girlfriend offered us mac & cheese off the stove that was probably there for at least a full day. He had these small scars all over his body and pointed out they were from some magical frog ceremony and explained he was a shaman or something like that.  \n  \nMy husband asked about the mannequins and he said \"I pretend they are my ex-wife and use them for target practice\" and asked my 10 year old son if he wanted to shoot at them. This was not in a rural area either with lots of land, this was a regular neighborhood with houses in close proximity.   \n  \nHe tried to give us a tortoise when we left, when we declined he wanted to give us a chicken instead.

The lack of respect and caring for you as an adult wears on you.  If they have a personality disorder you had to tiptoe around, it accelerates this process. \n\nThree major turning points\n1. Constant belittling of my kids.  None of us were good enough.  Critical comparisons to others.  My kids accomplishments were mocked. But if another of their grandkids did the same thing\u2026the heavens opened and light shown down on them with praises from heaven.  \nFor example 2 of my kids had national merit scholarships to a top 10 school for their degree.  Got them invited to the Governor\u2019s mansion for a luncheon with the other 20 in the state.\nMy niece gets National honor society and they send presents to her. They ignored my kids.  All were Duke TIP scholars, and 10 yrs later a nephew earns that.\nHe\u2019s praised.  There\u2019s something about them doing it to you, but once they do it to your kids, you cant let them.  We had already limited contact.\nNow both of those adult kids are doing well.  They have chosen not to have relationships with that set of grandparents.\n\n2. Playing my siblings against one another. Either praising one to me, or devaluing one to me. I shut it down but they continued with the others.  I\u2019ve become the evil one in their story\n\n3. How they speak about me when I\u2019m not there.  I\u2019ve heard from their friends some pretty awful things they\u2019ve said.  It started when I was very little. \nAs a teen though they told people I was on drugs, sleeping around etc.  I suspect they did it for sympathy, \u201cI have it so hard with Fritos\u201d.  I get married and move away. Run into a family friend 4 yrs later and hear how it\u2019s so great \u201cyou turned your life around\u201d. What?  That\u2019s when I heard what I supposedly was doing.  I wasn\u2019t using drugs. I wasn\u2019t sleeping around back then. \nThe last time I spoke with that parent and they were accusing me of some morally reprehensible behaviors, I ended up telling them that if that\u2019s what they believed of me, they should want nothing to do with me.  \n\nI\u2019ve been LC for 20 yrs.  And now NC for 5. It\u2019s a very painful decision to choose this.  It\u2019s seen as one day I just turned off the switch to them.  Where in reality it was 20 plus years of begging them to be more mature, to be an adult in our relationship.  If they had made changes we\u2019d not be estranged. \nThe decision was not made lightly.  I no longer have migraines and my health has improved significantly.",

She let me try on her clothes & told me I looked beautiful, but too grown up; that I would have to wait to wear certain dresses till I was older. She told me which jewelry would be mine one day & which would be my little sisters. She wasn't moody or stressed at all. Everything seemed good, & peaceful. The next day we were back at school, & then at home with dad, & she was gone.\n\nI was 12. I didn't know the reality of what had happened until I was 18 & I got a copy of her death certificate. I was really angry with her & torn for a long time. I felt abandoned. Now I'm in my 30s. I've lived more years without her than years I had with her. I think I understand her more now. I definitely feel a deeper empathy for what she was going through. I also feel incredibly sad, because she must have felt so alone.

There wasn\u2019t a later\u2026.\n\nAlso, a coworker / casual friend of my husband did the same thing.  They had worked together prior, but at this point not for about 3 years. She moved in the next neighborhood over and randomly popped over to say hi in the middle of dinner on night. We invited her in and chatted.

About 99% of the jobs posted on their websites (the company owned about 35 web domains) and shared on other websites are fake. The marketing and SEO department was tasked in creating super optimized job listings, that out performed real job listings. To apply to these job listings, you would have to register an account. This would inflate our candidate database and we would have loads of CVs. The sales team would then take this information and contact companies to get them to pay to put their open vacancies on our websites, because we had one of the largest candidate databases. I remember getting so annoyed by this practice I started reporting these vacancies as fake, even on LinkedIn. But LinkedIn rejected my report saying it was legitimate. It wasn\u2019t, and I know this because I created that fake vacancy.\n\nWhat makes this even more alarming, is that so many recruitment companies do this. If you want to apply for a job, you\u2019re better off going to that companies website instead and not using a third party. I left that place and swore I would never work in recruitment again.",

The very first thing they'll tell you to do is \"DON'T BUY ANYTHING\".\n\nIt's not meant to say, don't go buy lunch or a nice outfit, it's to deter people from making major purchases like homes, cars, etc.  Too many people have absolutely no idea how money works and end up letting the instant gratification take over and before long, they're broke.\n\nYou never hear of anyone being broke from investing their lottery wins.  It's always they blew it on real estate, cars, and boats.  They buy these things, then forget about taxes, insurance, upkeep, etc. And before long, just the recurring bills of maintaining is greater than what their investments can generate.\n\nThere's a saying, \"you can milk a cow a million times, but you can only butcher it once.\".   Why buy six homes when one of your interest checks can cover rent on it?  You could just rent a home for a month wherever you wanted and move around the globe.  But instead, owning these properties has some allure of grandeur to it, and people submerge themselves in debt.  \n\nFwiw, the people who won $32m after taxes, now draw about $100k per month in interest and dividends.  They listened to good advice.  They travel, give money to family/friends/community.  They own their primary home and vehicles, and rent the rest.  Let the risk of all that be on someone else.

He sustained a leg wound during his stand, and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition. Murphy rejoined his men, disregarding his own injury, and led them back to repel the Germans.

This was while Congress was actively blocking funding for a regime that was widely recognized as genocidal--Reagan actually rose private funds from American evangelical groups to make sure that he wouldn't run out of ammunition. Ultimately around 200,000 Maya were murdered.\n\nCentral American dictatorships of the Cold War are often accurately described as \"US-backed.\" However, in the case of Guatemala in the '80s--by far the worst--it's most accurate to say they were \"Reagan-backed,\" and it's a major reason why I think he is unambiguously not just the worst American President, but one of the great villains of the twentieth century.",

Sometimes multiple teams play together, sometimes teams play in opposition, but in everything, it's you plus your spouse. This goes especially, especially true when it's you against your family or friends (the fastest way to a divorce is allowing your parents, in-laws, or friends to make decisions for your team) or when it's you against a problem (the second fastest way to a divorce is to approach any given problem as if your spouse is your opponent instead of the problem itself).\n\nAlso, decisions in a marriage require two yes and one no. If you want to move your mother in and your spouse doesn't, that's gonna end badly. If your spouse wants kids and you don't, that's gonna end badly. If you want to move seven states away and your spouse doesn't, that's gonna end badly.\n\nLastly, if you ever find yourself struggling to connect with your partner when they are struggling with something, ask them which of the five As they need right now:\n\n* Attention \u2013 all they are looking for is someone to hear them out, they need no other action at this time, and they don\u2019t even need you to respond other than acknowledging that you are listening.\n* Affirmation (or Affection) \u2013 they want you to listen and agree with them, have their back, lift them up, but that\u2019s all they need right now. Importantly, it may be the case that you don\u2019t necessarily agree with them about this issue, but right now they need to know you have their back, and you can deal with it later. This often involves a hug and reassurance.\n* Advice \u2013 they are seeking your counsel on how to solve the problem or deal with the situation but they don\u2019t need you to do anything other than provide input.

There is nothing better than aguachile or ceviche on a hot day. And the simple vegetable dishes are always delicious too.\n\nThailand and Vietnam- I have never visited either country but eaten at a lot of U.S. restaurants with the respective  cuisines. They just taste so fresh, and their use of sweet, sour, savory is so vibrant and alive. \n\nMy family is from a European country known for their food too, and I find the food from there very bland and heavy. It\u2019s not bad, but it just doesn\u2019t do it the way Mexican, Thai, and Vietnamese do it for me.",

His decision forced me to give up on the idea that somewhere deep inside of him he still had a resemblance of the man I fell in love with.\n\n- I did of course let him know that his comment really hurt my feelings. He just doubled down on why he felt that way and why he had a right to tell me.\n\n- Only afterwards did I realize the kind of abuse this man put me through. It is almost impossible to recognize it while you\u2019re in the midst of it, especially when it escalates so gradually.\n\n- To everyone replying with your kind comments: thank you so much!

There was additional faffing about with German companies over import taxes and such that caused us a shortage of other materials. All sorted now, but it was a tense few months. \n\n\n- At the university lab, in addition to above difficulties with suppliers, getting kicked out of the EUs Horizons program lopped a huge amount of funding out from British science. Numbers of EU students have also dropped, so now because of the drop in funding  our financial department is cracking down hard. \nThis leads to ridiculous situations like having to go get 3 alternative quotes for a piece of machinery that is only manufactured by a single company, even when your grant is specifically for that machine.",
