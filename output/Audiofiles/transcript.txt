What's THE secret you discovered that made you leave your ex? 

*The guy she was cheating on me with found out about me. He found me at a bar told me about it, bought me a drink, and I immediately got on the phone and broke up with her.Â 


I'm not going to go into super deep detail, but it was nice to have an honorable dude give me the warning instead of weeks of suspicion. I was about to get an apartment with her, and I dodged a bullet.

*Saw a message preview on her lockscreen of a dude heart reacting to a message from her saying   
"at least you know whenever I'm with him I'm thinking of you".   
We had just come back from a holiday for our anniversary and moved in together...
