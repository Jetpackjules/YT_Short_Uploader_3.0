What is your deepest darkest secret?

*My grandfather stole a red pepper shaker from an Italian restaurant many years ago. The year after he passed, we went to the same restaurant. In honor of him, I stole a parmesan shaker for a matching pair. R.I.P. Grandpa.

*I once ate a party platter of delicious tropical fruit during a tour in Honduras and blamed it on monkeys

*I couldn't pick up the pieces after my divorce.  Would go weeks without showering or brushing my teeth.  I found my "baby blanket" from my youth in a trunk and wrapped it around myself that night.  Best sleep I had had in years.  I keep it in my bed since then.  I am a 42 year old man.

*I farted so bad and smelly once they had to evacuate my Spanish class to search for a gas leak.
