What is something they said on a first date that immediately prevented a second?

*within the first 10 minutes, my date said, 'i have restraining order against my ex-wife, but she's my bestfriend and the love of my life.' That sounded like he was already in several complicated relationships and that I should go.

*“Don't call me. My husband checks my phone”

*"I'm posting everything we say on Instagram. And I'm getting suggestions on what to ask you from my followers".

Went "to the toilet" and left.

*She called her ex boyfriend "cheap" because he would only take her out to eat 2-3 times per week and cooked the other days.
