What is the boldest thing you've seen someone do to greatly lower their cost of living?

*My younger brother decided to be a train hopper for roughly half the year so he doesn't have to pay for rent.

*I remember reading a story about a guy who had an internship at some big tech firm, I think Google, in an extremely HCOL area. He bought an old uhaul and outfitted it for living. He parked in the company lot as obscurely as possible and moved every so often. Used the company showers and such. Probably the best way to manage that situation if you could handle it.Â 

*I had a friend who would go to farmer's markets and wait until the end of the day, then go up to people and offer to buy the leftovers at a discount. Not terribly exciting, but bold.
