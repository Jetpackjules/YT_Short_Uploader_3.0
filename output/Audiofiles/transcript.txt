What do you secretly judge people for?

*People's self awareness like when they watch Tik toks loud in a quiet room without headphones. Or not knowing how to act in certain establishments.

*People who throw trash out of their cars onto the highway or street. People who just deliberately litter outdoors in a park or at an event.

*Parents being jerks to their children and stepchildren.

*Being obliviously in the way. Like getting to the end of an escalator and just standing there. Or standing with a group of people in a doorway or aisle. Or stopping to stare at your phone in the middle of the sidewalk.

Just move out of the way like 2 steps and everyones life is easier.

*Things they decide to post online

*When people don't clear their tables and leave rubbish behind at food courts or fast food restaurants.
