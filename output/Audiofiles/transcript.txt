Police officers of reddit, what are some things innocent people do that make them seem suspicious?

*I know this isn't what was asked, but I've always been told, if you want to look inconspicuous around police, pick your nose. Nobody picks their nose if they think they're being watched

*Retired police here from UK. Innocent people seem to confess everything even when not a crime as they're so desperate not to be in trouble. Example  - knocking on doors for information. Guy answers door and immediately started to confess his tyres are a little bald and he has some dodgy cigarettes and he did accidents drop some litter. Like dude..chill out, it's fine.

*Former LEO.  I can tell you the most helpful thing for you, yet most infuriating (to the LEO) is to keep your mouth shut.  Just, you know, quit talking.  It will be much better for you in the long run.  I was never looking to just jam somebody up, but man people get themselves in so much trouble with their mouth.
