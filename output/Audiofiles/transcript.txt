If you died as an atheist and then met God, what would you say to him?

*Oh

*Hey, where have you been?!

*Holy shit God from Bible???????????????

*"You won't believe what people down there are doing in your name!"  
or  
"You need a better PR team"

*So.. ummm... which one are you?

*I'm genuinely as shocked as you are

*After almost 5 years working with pediatric neurosurgery I would just ask "why?"

*"...Do you take constructive criticism?"

*You don't look like Alanis Morissette...

*I'd like to talk to your manager please.

*Good job on "boobs", big fan
