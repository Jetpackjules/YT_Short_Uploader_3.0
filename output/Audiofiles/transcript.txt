What were the warning signs before someone you know killed themselves?

*My mom asked for a hug when I was 14, at that age I was like "nobody touches me", she insisted for the hug, I hugged her, it was the last time I saw her.

I'm kinda good with it now but for two decades I was like "I should've guess something was wrong"

EDIT : Thank you for the kind words everyone, I'm mostly a lurker on reddit but this topic is important to me, keep sending love to the people you care about and please please please, ask for help if you need some, there is no shame in it.

*I remember one of my classmates who had been struggling with severe depression suddenly became very jolly and smiled at all of us. We were so happy and thought she had finally found a way to be happy again. It was a sudden and noticeable change, but sadly, she didn't come to school the next day, and we later found out she had ended her life.
