What statistically improbable thing happened to you?

*Surviving a drowning having been gone for 12-15 minutes, resuscitated, 2 days on life support, lost a third of my bodyweight and walked out of the hospital less than a week later. Full clean bill of health two weeks after that. No permanent damage

*Car was broken into, everything stolen including handbag in boot with wedding ring and engagement ring. Bag was found in a field weeks later and handed into police and we were called to see if it was ours. There had been a hole in the pocket where the rings were and they had fallen into it and were still there.

*I won $30,000 from a slot machine and paid off all my student loans that week.
