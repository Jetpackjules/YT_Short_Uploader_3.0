What brand is huge, but you don't know a single person who buys their products?

*I just want to know who keeps Long John Silver's in business

*Reddit Ads

*Who is buying all these Supreme tshirts? Like what happened that brought you to that moment?

*betterhelp...all over my podcast ads

*Kylie Cosmetics

*Im convinced that all major mattress centers are actually fronts for criminal enterprise. In a time when businesses are shutting down left and right, how do we have 5 mattress stores all on one street doing just fine? Go into any one of them and you'll be the first customer theyve seen in days. What are they really doing?

*GOOP (Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness shit).  It's always in the news and apparently makes money.... Who is buying it?! 

*What A Room Custom Sofas, I've seen them recommend on reddit a lot but never heard of anyone that bought them. Thinking about pulling the trigger but its always hard to buy a couch online without actually sitting on them.
