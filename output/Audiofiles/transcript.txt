What do guys do after breakup?

*Suffer, just like everyone else.

*After a breakup, guys usually go through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, sad playlists, and gym memberships

*Just got out of a 14 year relationship like 8hrs ago,I'm doing awesome,but there went.my 20s

*Get poor sleep for a month, eat crappy, ponder on the time wasted. Then eventually get back to semi normality.Â 

*Delete Facebook, hit the gym, lawyer up

the golden formula

*work all day to keep my mind busy.
