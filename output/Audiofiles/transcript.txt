What would  be your reaction if Donald Trump dies tonight?

*Well, my reaction would be that you should have a very strong alibi for tonight, just in case.

*Wouldn't it be really weird if he actually drops dead tonight

*"You should never say bad things about the dead, only good. Joan Crawford is dead... good!" - Bette Davis

*There's absolutely no way the conspiracy crowd would see it as just a normal thing that happens to old people. I'd be pretty worried tbh.

*Thanks Obama!

*I think it was Mark Twain that said while he'd never wish death on anyone, he's not been too upset at reading their obituary

*Tonight - this weekend?  Well, it will all depend on if he returns in 3 days.

*Look, I was out till 3 AM “all claws no laws” after a metal show last night. I'm bruised and hungover, and all I want to do is eat my weight in eggs Benedict. 

But if I gotta go party with my people, I gotta go party with my people.
