What seems to be overpriced, but in reality is 100% worth it?

*An Uber home instead of a DUI. Whether it's court costs, the (more than monetary) costs of an accident, and the issue of having a suspended license. It's not worth it, don't drink and drive.

Edit: My most upvoted comment is about not drinking and driving. I'm happy about that.

*Good shoes and socks.

*Sunscreen

*A quality sofa. One from What A Room custom sofas, Room & Board, Arhaus or Flexsteel. Don't go for the junk from Joybird, Ashley, Burrow, West Elm, etc.

*Mattress, Shoes, Dental Care, Jacket.

In that order.

*A good mattress.

*Tailored clothing. Wearing clothing that fits correctly is more comfortable, looks better, and tends to be of a quality that lasts longer.
