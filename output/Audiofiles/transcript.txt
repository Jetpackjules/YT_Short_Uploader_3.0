What screams “I have depression”? 

*Sleeping to avoid living. Even if you're not necessarily tired.

*completely tired all the time, even when you don't do anything

*Constantly in a world in your head. I struggle with living like this. My mind and body are normally never in the same place.

*Intense irritation at small things.

*Feeling like it's a chore to do things that you used to love doing.

*Snoozing for an eternity because you know what awaits you when you get up and face the day.

*Just kinda waiting for the day to end each day

*Depression doesn't scream, it would require too much energy.

*losing interest in literally everything and opting to just sleep instead.

at one point I couldnt even bring myself to watch tv or netflix etc., I just did not care. same with being on my phone. then I lost interest in being awake and so sleep, beautiful beautiful sleep, became the answer.

so I would say... that. lol
