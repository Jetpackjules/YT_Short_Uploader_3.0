What are the not-so-obvious signs of a person with low emotional intelligence?

*Not being curious of why you feel a certain way.

*Not being aware of their emotional triggers which leads to them regularly making themselves angry or upset when it could have been avoided.

*Some comments in here seem to be confusing emotional intelligence with intellectual intelligence,  this question is only asking about emotional intelligence.  These are not one and the same. 

*They immediately get angry if they perceive that someone is telling them no, or trying to tell them what to do.

*The inability to self reflect.
