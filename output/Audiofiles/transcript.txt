What's the most shocking transformation you've ever seen?

*My aunt before cancer vs shortly after dying

No amount of dead people on TV or the internet prepares you for seeing it in person

*I went to elementary school with a kid who was a little chubby, on the shorter side, wore glasses, didn't really dress in a way that was considered "cool" and was kind of bullied by other kids sometimes. I always felt bad for him because he was nice and I heard some things about his family situation from a girl who lived on his street, and allegedly he was physically abused by his stepdad.

Didn't see him for years after 8th grade and then ran into him while I was in the Marines, but home on leave when we were 18 or 19. He was also in the Marines & home on leave as well, so were hanging out one night & bonding over that. Anyway, I totally didn't recognize him at all when I first ran intoh im. He'd gotten tall, shed the extra pounds, was completely jacked, and his arms were covered in tattoos. If he wasn't such a nice guy, he'd have looked intimidating.We all know examples of tropes that makes it clear that a male author is writing a female character, but what are some that make it obvious that a female author it writing a male character?

*Female authors seem to describe the color of a man's hair much more than male authors. Particularly if it is graying.

*Ways I'd romantically describe my 50 year old husbands eyes.

His eyes are sullen blue, like a winter morning, with flecks of metallic grey they remind me of his steel town origins.  In the summer, their blueness becomes deeper and richer, like a topaz.

Way he describes his eyes.

Blue I think.  I dunno.  Are they still blue or something?  I mean, do they change and that with age?  Wait..are they blue? What's the creepiest thing a member of your family has ever said?

*My little sister (toddler at the time) needed to have a small surgery. They were at the check in with the doctor and she was playing with toys. During a break in the adult's conversation, they heard my sister have one doll say to the other, “this is my dad. He hits me allll the time.”

My dad did not hit us. The doctor had to ask a few very awkward questions to get it sorted.

*I had an uncle buy me silk underwear for my 16th birthday and when I opened it said “you should try it on right now”.

*I was babysitting my nephew overnight and he told me there was people on the stairs

*Welp, as an uncle it really sucks coming into this thread.
