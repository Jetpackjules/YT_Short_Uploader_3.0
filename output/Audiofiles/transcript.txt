What is an example of “if it's free, you are the product”?

*Free VPN.

*When I cook for friends. Surprise idiots! I'm doing this for the pleasure of your wonderful company! You fools!

*Reddit. They spent years getting you to create content that you do not own. They have now sold it. 

*Nightclubs that only charge men for the entrance

*The $450 in visa gift cards I can get at work for doing their health and wellness program.

*Say you're watching a video on YouTube (or broadcast tv, radio, etc.) The creator isn't selling the video itself to make money, they're selling advertisers the fact that you will be watching their video and seeing an ad. You aren't exchanging money for a product, the advertiser is exchanging money for your views.
