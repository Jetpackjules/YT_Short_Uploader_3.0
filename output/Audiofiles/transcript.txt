*I don't know why but it's the "I'll see myself out" after a joke

*RIP your DMs

More a commentary on the average redditor than the one who puts this as a comment.

*"This."

*Edit: thanks for the upvotes!

edit edit: wow guys didnt expect the support. thanks for the upvotes!

*"shut up and take my up vote" or "take my up vote and get out"
