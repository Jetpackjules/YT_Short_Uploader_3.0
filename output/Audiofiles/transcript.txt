What's something that seemed totally harmless when you were a kid but now feels super weird or creepy as an adult?

*AOL chatrooms

*My elementary school gym coach giving birthday spankings while the other kids cheered.

*We rode our bikes behind the mosquito  fogging truck that rode through our neighborhood in summer, thinking it was fun. 
 All approved by adults.  Found out later that the fog was DDT

*The 25-30 year old man at my local Dollar General who wanted to take me on a date when I was 16.

*being called "mature for my age" from older guys. 

Now, I look back on it and makes my stomach hurt.
