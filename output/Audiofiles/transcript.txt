What is your "I'm calling it now" prediction?

*Jo Jo siwa's mental breakdown

*We've only just begun to see what small drone warfare looks like. These war flying tech breakthroughs always start with simple recon and dropping bombs. Soon they'll have guns and fly in coordinated swarms.

*AI responses to all questions will be sponsored and yield responses that favor the advertiser rather than objective responses based on available evidence.

*Starbucks will be selling bubble tea by 2027.

Edit: For clarification, I mean classic bubble tea (sweet and creamy leaf tea with tapioca pearls), not fruity drinks with popping “boba” juice balls.

*Grown up children of Youtube family vloggers will start dropping Mommy Dearest style exposés about their horrible childhoods and laws will be imposed against the whole practice.
