6
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:04,270
*A slow-burn

7
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:04,929
collapse is much

8
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:05,570
more likely than a

9
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,430
single major event

10
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,110
to cause something

11
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,002
major.

12
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,300
*As a kid I learned

13
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,910
that if a gamma

14
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:10,619
ray burst is

15
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:11,541
coming right at us

16
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,259
we really can't do

17
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,269
anything about it,

18
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:13,699
we'd just get

19
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:14,853
fried.

20
00:00:14,853 --> 00:00:15,550
Kept me up for a

21
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,879
few nights.

22
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,967
*Corn virus.

23
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:18,859
20% of Human

24
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:19,589
Civilization's

25
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,010
calories,

26
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,309
right there.

27
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,370
*A Gamma Ray Burst

28
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:22,903
could fry our

29
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:23,609
planet at any

30
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:24,379
moment with 0

31
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:25,460
warning.

32
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:25,920
Which means you

33
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,600
should not waste

34
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,120
time worrying

35
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,750
about it because

36
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,260
no one can do

37
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,711
anything about it.

38
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:30,480
*I rarely see the

39
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,960
media being

40
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,510
concerned about

41
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,325
water.

42
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:33,030
*Solar flare

43
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,477
knocking out

44
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:34,640
electric grids.

45
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,509
Not only restarting

46
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:36,280
them from a black

47
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,022
start is highly

48
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:37,909
complicated,

49
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:38,123
if the

50
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:38,761
transformers are

51
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,490
fried, there

52
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:39,912
aren't enough

53
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:40,814
replacements,

54
00:00:40,814 --> 00:00:41,670
and to manufacture

55
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,115
more we need,

56
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:44,149
you guessed it,

57
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:45,023
electricity.

58
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:45,810
The estimations are

59
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,700
that a solar flare

60
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,210
on the level of

61
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,068
Carrington event,

62
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:48,790
which happened not

63
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,782
two centuries ago,

64
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:50,142
would cause

65
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:50,670
trillions in

66
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,757
damages and set

67
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:52,609
back civilization

68
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:53,290
for decades.
