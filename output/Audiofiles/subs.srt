6
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:03,520
*I went through

7
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,160
a phase when I

8
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,400
watched

9
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,830
Groundhog Day

10
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,360
dozens of

11
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,450
times, over

12
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,305
and over,

13
00:00:08,305 --> 00:00:08,859
often while I

14
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:09,310
was doing

15
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,610
other tasks.

16
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,230
It became kind

17
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:11,660
of a soothing

18
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,199
background for

19
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:12,651
me.

20
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:13,119
And yes,

21
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:13,400
I'm quite

22
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,830
aware of the

23
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,938
irony of

24
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:14,580
playing

25
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,650
Groundhog Day

26
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,426
over and over.

27
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:18,509
*Office Space

28
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:19,110
is pretty much

29
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:19,899
a white noise

30
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:20,620
machine for

31
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,089
bedtime now.

32
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:22,887
*The Mummy...

33
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:23,570
Brendan Frazier

34
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,690
movie, not the

35
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,589
very old one

36
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:27,194
or Tom Cruise
