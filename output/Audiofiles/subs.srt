00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:04,771
my parents,

not me During

the bride and

14
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:08,222

00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:08,372
they were

16
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:08,829
going to have

married,

22
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,302
so everyone

23
00:00:12,302 --> 00:00:12,772
assumed they

24
00:00:12,772 --> 00:00:13,152
were going to

25
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:13,562
have kids

26
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:14,072
immediately

27
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:14,412
after getting

00:00:14,412 --> 00:00:15,461

The groom

30
00:00:15,854 --> 00:00:16,530

The Bride burst

35
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:20,025
into tears and

36
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:20,475

00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:24,261
that's

42
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:24,641
something they

long time,

47
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:27,814
