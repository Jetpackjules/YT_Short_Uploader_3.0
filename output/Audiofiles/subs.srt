6
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,520
*Well, my

7
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,080
reaction would

8
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,370
be that you

9
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,730
should have a

10
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,421
very strong

11
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:05,921
alibi for

12
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:06,433
tonight,

13
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:07,689
just in case.

14
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:08,160
*Wouldn't it be

15
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:08,710
really weird

16
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,179
if he actually

17
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:09,652
drops dead

18
00:00:09,652 --> 00:00:10,039
tonight

19
00:00:10,039 --> 00:00:10,742
*

20
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:11,019
You should

21
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:11,760
never say bad

22
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,184
things about

23
00:00:12,184 --> 00:00:12,640
the dead,

24
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,839
only good.

25
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,449
Joan Crawford

26
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,024
is dead...

27
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:15,725
good!

28
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:16,931
- Bette Davis

29
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:17,250
*There's

30
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:17,850
absolutely no

31
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,166
way the

32
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:18,724
conspiracy

33
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:19,060
crowd would

34
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:19,609
see it as just

35
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,160
a normal thing

36
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,640
that happens

37
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,410
to old people.

38
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:21,929
I'd be pretty

39
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:23,366
worried tbh.

40
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:24,869
*Thanks Obama!

41
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:25,390
*I think it was

42
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:25,850
Mark Twain

43
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,829
that said

44
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:27,190
while he'd

45
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:27,739
never wish

46
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:28,070
death on

47
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,736
anyone,

48
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:29,247
he's not been

49
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:29,857
too upset at

50
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:30,300
reading their

51
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,759
obituary

52
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:32,430
*Tonight - this

53
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,497
weekend?

54
00:00:33,497 --> 00:00:34,060
Well, it will

55
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,750
all depend on

56
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,259
if he returns

57
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:36,429
in 3 days.

58
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:37,080
*Look, I was

59
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,090
out till 3 AM

60
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,729
all claws no

61
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:39,181
laws

62
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:39,549
after a metal

63
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:39,974
show last

64
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:40,371
night.

65
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,010
I'm bruised and

66
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:41,649
hungover,

67
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,144
and all I want

68
00:00:42,144 --> 00:00:42,686
to do is eat

69
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:43,240
my weight in

70
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,300
eggs Benedict.

71
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,820
But if I gotta

72
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,410
go party with

73
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,225
my people,

74
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:46,789
I gotta go

75
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:47,376
party with my

76
00:00:47,376 --> 00:00:47,805
people.
