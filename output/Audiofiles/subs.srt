1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,221
What screams I have

2
00:00:01,221 --> 00:00:02,374
depression?

3
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:03,339
completely tired

4
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:04,194
all the time,

5
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:05,426
even when you dont

6
00:00:05,426 --> 00:00:05,540
do

7
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,883
anythingSleeping

8
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,105
to avoid living.

9
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:08,900
Even if youre not

10
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,640
necessarily

11
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,199
tired.Constantly

12
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:11,980
in a world in your

13
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,694
head.

14
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:13,420
I struggle with

15
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,830
living like this.

16
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:15,859
My mind and body

17
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:16,760
are normally never

18
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,300
in the same

19
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,761
place.Intense

20
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:19,594
irritation at

21
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:19,923
small

22
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:21,379
things.Feeling

23
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,216
like its a chore

24
00:00:22,216 --> 00:00:23,000
to do things that

25
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,700
you used to love

26
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,839
doing.Snoozing for

27
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,508
an eternity

28
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:27,120
because you know

29
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,780
what awaits you

30
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,480
when you get up

31
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,300
and face the day.I

32
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,343
was driving,

33
00:00:31,343 --> 00:00:32,400
as I frequently do

34
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,373
for work,

35
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:34,159
and realized I

36
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,620
didn't have

37
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,500
Spotify or the

38
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,595
radio on.

39
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:38,000
I am a music nut.

40
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,820
I had been driving

41
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,579
that way for

42
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,520
hours.

43
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,159
Thought back and

44
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,143
had multiple days

45
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,460
like that.

46
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,479
Just wasn't

47
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,798
interested in it.

48
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:47,659
That was weirdly a

49
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:48,560
big wake up call

50
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,619
for me.

51
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:53,579
**EDIT:** This blew

52
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,550
up way more than I

53
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,872
thought it would,

54
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:56,460
so I thought I

55
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,322
would clarify

56
00:00:57,322 --> 00:00:57,943
since this is

57
00:00:57,943 --> 00:00:58,520
getting a lot of

58
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,240
exposure.

59
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,960
Not listening to

60
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,060
music is in NO way

61
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,859
a sure-fire

62
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:05,739
diagnosis for

63
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:07,053
depression.

64
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:07,884
Even in my most

65
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:08,720
mentally-healthy

66
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,094
phases, there is

67
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:11,100
definitely times

68
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,902
when I drive/cook/

69
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:14,099
hang out in silence

70
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,920
at times.

71
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,797
That's normal.

72
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:18,659
What isn't normal

73
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:19,299
is that I've been

74
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,307
listening to music

75
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:21,099
since I was really

76
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:22,620
young, and really

77
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,519
got into it when I

78
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,447
was like 9-10.

79
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:26,540
Music is probably

80
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,861
my main hobby.

81
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:28,799
In a job where I'm

82
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,640
on the road for

83
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,659
anywhere from 30

84
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:31,799
mins to 6 hours a

85
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,459
day, I listen to

86
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,560
music all the time

87
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,920
when I'm not on

88
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,959
the phone for

89
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:39,003
work.

90
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:40,420
One day, I had been

91
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:40,980
driving for

92
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,362
several hours,

93
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:43,428
and just felt...

94
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:44,140
numb.

95
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,341
I had a realization

96
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:46,337
that no music was

97
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,000
playing- this got

98
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,300
me thinking about

99
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,479
how long this had

100
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,389
been going on,

101
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:51,299
and I realized I

102
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,019
had been driving

103
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:52,739
like this for a

104
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,329
few weeks now.

105
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,560
I also love to cook

106
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,040
and listen to

107
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,739
music- I'll sing

108
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:58,303
along, make up

109
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,819
lyrics, sing to my

110
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,180
son, and generally

111
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,096
have fun.

112
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,099
I had stopped doing

113
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:04,188
this as well.

114
00:02:04,188 --> 00:02:04,819
I was already

115
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:05,700
growing concerned

116
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,048
about depression,

117
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:07,866
so I discussed

118
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:08,360
this with my

119
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,331
psychologist/

120
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:11,522
therapist and PCP.

121
00:02:11,522 --> 00:02:12,700
They both agreed,

122
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,419
after several

123
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,575
discussions,

124
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:15,000
that I am

125
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,500
clinically

126
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,600
depressed and that

127
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,919
not having

128
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,720
interest in things

129
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,745
you once loved is

130
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:20,500
definitely a sign

131
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,604
of depression.

132
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,300
So it was one of

133
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,280
the first real

134
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,176
"wake-up" calls

135
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,712
for me.
