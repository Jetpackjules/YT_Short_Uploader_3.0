9
00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:06,080
*I know this

10
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,571
isn't what was

11
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,209
asked, but

12
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:07,740
I've always

13
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,369
been told,

14
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:08,800
if you want to

15
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,000
look

16
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,733
inconspicuous

17
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,840
around police,

18
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,140
pick your

19
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,650
nose.

20
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,270
Nobody picks

21
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:12,752
their nose if

22
00:00:12,752 --> 00:00:13,040
they think

23
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,250
they're being

24
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,499
watched

25
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:15,269
*Retired police

26
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,729
here from UK.

27
00:00:16,729 --> 00:00:17,350
Innocent people

28
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:17,670
seem to

29
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,010
confess

30
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,651
everything

31
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:19,149
even when not

32
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:19,750
a crime as

33
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,089
they're so

34
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:20,730
desperate not

35
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:20,980
to be in

36
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,800
trouble.

37
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,533
Example

38
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:23,019
- knocking on

39
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:23,420
doors for

40
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,530
information.

41
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,120
Guy answers

42
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,519
door and

43
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:25,989
immediately

44
00:00:25,989 --> 00:00:26,430
started to

45
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,309
confess his

46
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:27,809
tyres are a

47
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:28,709
little bald

48
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:28,940
and he has

49
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,420
some dodgy

50
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,250
cigarettes and

51
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:30,339
he did

52
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:30,940
accidents drop

53
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,961
some litter.

54
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:32,835
Like dude..

55
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:33,336
chill out,

56
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,399
it's fine.

57
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,579
*Former LEO.

58
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:36,119
I can tell you

59
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,410
the most

60
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,000
helpful thing

61
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,445
for you,

62
00:00:37,445 --> 00:00:37,920
yet most

63
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,869
infuriating to

64
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:39,731
the LEO is to

65
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,000
keep your

66
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,789
mouth shut.

67
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:41,757
Just, you know,

68
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:42,479
quit talking.

69
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,090
It will be much

70
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,429
better for you

71
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:43,789
in the long

72
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:44,292
run.

73
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:44,770
I was never

74
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,100
looking to

75
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:45,560
just jam

76
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,269
somebody up,

77
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:47,009
but man people

78
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:47,560
get themselves

79
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,179
in so much

80
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:48,518
trouble with

81
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:49,424
their mouth.
