4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,939
*Frozen fruits and

5
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:05,673
vegetables.

6
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,645
The modern flash-

7
00:00:06,645 --> 00:00:07,484
freeze technique

8
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:08,391
preserves almost

9
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:08,810
all of the

10
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,089
nutrients and they

11
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:11,042
are always picked

12
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:11,570
when they are in

13
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,179
season, so they

14
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,109
are as nutritious

15
00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:15,038
as their fresh in-

16
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:15,485
season

17
00:00:15,485 --> 00:00:16,730
counterparts,

18
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,089
and more

19
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:18,019
nutritious if it

20
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,794
is not the season.

21
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:20,611
*Sport during

22
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,990
pregnancy.

23
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,127
Actually a lot of

24
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:23,839
things are healthy

25
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:24,730
during pregnancy

26
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:25,910
theres just too

27
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,910
much

28
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,633
misinformation.

29
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:28,519
If your doctor

30
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,670
explicitly says no

31
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,561
sport then yes.

32
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,606
Do that.

33
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:33,600
But if doctor says

34
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,917
ok then go ahead

35
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:36,729
*Doing literally

36
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:37,240
nothing to

37
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,846
decompress.

38
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:39,930
Sometimes one just

39
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,810
needs to breathe

40
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,490
and look out a

41
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,550
window.

42
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,715
*Crying.

43
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:44,460
*Spending time

44
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,323
alone.
