1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
If you could

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
have the body

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
type of an

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Olympian,

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
which sport

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
would you

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
choose?

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Male rowers

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
are casually

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
lumberjacks.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'd like to

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
have a tree

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
chopping

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
physique.

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Why wish,

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
when I already

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
have the

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
physique of an

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Olympian?

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
US men's

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
curling team

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
to be precise.

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Rock climber.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Then I would be

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
good at rock

26
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
climbing,

27
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
something

28
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
which I've

29
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
tried and

30
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
failed to be

31
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
good at for

32
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
more than a

33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
decade.

34
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Pole vault,

35
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
apparently

36
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
they've got it

37
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
where it

38
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
counts.

39
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Gymnastics.

40
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I think they

41
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
all look so

42
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
lean & toned

43
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
with explosive

44
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
muscles.

45
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Rugby.

46
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Those women are

47
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
built like

48
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
tanks and I am

49
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
here for it.

50
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Swimmer

51
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Beach

52
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Volleyball and

53
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
it's not

54
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
close.

55
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Figure skater.

56
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
⛸️❄️🤍What

57
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
massively

58
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
improved your

59
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
mental health?

60
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Stay active.

61
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Staying active

62
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
is as good for

63
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
the brain as

64
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
it is for the

65
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
body.

66
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Regular

67
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
exercise or

68
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
activity can

69
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
have a major

70
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
impact on your

71
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
mental and

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
stress,

76
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
improve

77
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
memory,

78
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and help you

79
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
sleep better.

80
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
*Gardening!

81
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040
Ever since I

82
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,140
started

83
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,150
gardening

84
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,150
landscaping

85
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,150
included

86
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,170
because I

87
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,291
landscaped my

88
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:00,570
backyard for

89
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:00,610
the garden lol

90
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,730
my mental

91
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:00,970
health

92
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,030
gradually

93
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,270
increased and

94
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:01,399
my outlook in

95
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:01,600
life became

96
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,302
more positive.

97
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:02,446
Bonus for also

98
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:02,655
growing my own

99
00:00:02,655 --> 00:00:03,072
food along the

100
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,092
way. :

101
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
*Stepping down

102
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
my high horse.

103
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
Understanding

104
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
that I am only

105
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
human and do

106
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
not always

107
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
have to be the

108
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
best in

109
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
everything.

110
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
As a matter of

111
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
fact, there is

112
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
no

113
00:00:03,092 --> -1:59:59,000
being best

114
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

115
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
Therefore,

116
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
I learned to

117
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
forgive myself

118
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
and approve my

119
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
emotions.

120
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
That is what

121
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
set me

122
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
free.What was

123
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
the most major

124
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
cultural

125
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
difference you

126
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
noticed when

127
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
you moved to

128
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
another

129
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
country?

130
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
*Realizing that

131
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
jaywalking in

132
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
Vietnam is

133
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
basically an

134
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
extreme sport.

135
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
*I know this is

136
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,092
gonna sound

137
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:03,443
dumb, but when

138
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:03,443
I visited USA

139
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:03,517
the first

140
00:00:03,517 --> 00:00:03,532
thing that I

141
00:00:03,532 --> 00:00:03,633
was in awe

142
00:00:03,633 --> 00:00:03,873
about, was the

143
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
trees, because

144
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
they looked

145
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
different than

146
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
the ones from

147
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
Australia.

148
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
I just kept

149
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
looking at all

150
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
the different

151
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
trees and

152
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
flowers,

153
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
because they

154
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
were not the

155
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
same ones I

156
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
would drive

157
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
past for the

158
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
majority of my

159
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
life.

160
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
*The most major

161
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
cultural

162
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
difference was

163
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
discovering

164
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
that in some

165
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
countries,

166
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
it's perfectly

167
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:03,873
normal to eat

168
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:04,235
dinner at 10

169
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:04,523
PM.

170
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
My stomach was

171
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
on a strict

172
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
early dinner

173
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
schedule and

174
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
was not

175
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
prepared for

176
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
this late-

177
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
night culinary

178
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
adventureWhy

179
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
not just leave

180
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
a relationship

181
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,523
instead of

182
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:04,889
cheat?

183
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:05,522
*A friend of

184
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:05,803
mine once

185
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:05,943
chose to cheat

186
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:05,943
instead of

187
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:06,053
leaving her

188
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:06,063
relationship.

189
00:00:06,063 --> 00:00:06,133
She told me she

190
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:06,163
was scared of

191
00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:06,173
being alone

192
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:06,493
and felt

193
00:00:06,493 --> 00:00:06,698
guilty about

194
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:07,023
hurting her

195
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:07,153
partner,

196
00:00:07,153 --> 00:00:07,483
so she stayed

197
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:07,654
and ended up

198
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:08,043
making things

199
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:08,313
worse.

200
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:08,313
In the end,

201
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:08,313
it caused more

202
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:08,313
pain for

203
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:08,313
everyone

204
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:08,689
involved,

205
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:08,764
and she

206
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:08,764
regretted not

207
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:08,864
being honest

208
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:08,944
from the

209
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:08,984
start.

210
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
*some people

211
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
want to have

212
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
their cake and

213
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
eat it

214
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
*You can have

215
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
80% of your

216
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
needs met in a

217
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
relationship

218
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
which is great

219
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
and I think

220
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
this is about

221
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
the best most

222
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
people can get

223
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:08,984
from a

224
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:09,314
partner,

225
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:09,474
but then there

226
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:09,674
will always be

227
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
that 20%

228
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
missing.

229
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
People don't

230
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
want to lose

231
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
the 80%,

232
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
but they're

233
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
greedy enough

234
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
to look for

235
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
that 20%

236
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
elsewhere.What's

237
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
one thing that

238
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
can instantly

239
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,674
make you bond

240
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:09,684
with a total

241
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:09,684
stranger?

242
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:09,684
*Being lost or

243
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:09,684
confused and

244
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:09,684
finding

245
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:09,684
someone who is

246
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:09,684
equally lost

247
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:10,105
or confused..

248
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:10,588
*When we both

249
00:00:10,588 --> 00:00:10,755
are the only

250
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:10,755
two people to

251
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:11,215
see someone do

252
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:11,215
something

253
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:11,275
really weird

254
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:11,555
and then we

255
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:11,905
exchange those

256
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:11,905
what the fuck

257
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:11,905
glances

258
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:11,905
*An apropos

259
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:11,905
comment.

260
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:12,255
On a

261
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:12,255
particularly

262
00:00:12,255 --> 00:00:12,265
cold Colorado

263
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:12,545
morning,

264
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:12,555
a total

265
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:12,605
stranger and I

266
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:12,605
entered a

267
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:12,928
Target store

268
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:13,115
nearly the

269
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:13,435
same time.

270
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
As she turned

271
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
to hold the

272
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
door for me

273
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
she

274
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
questioned,

275
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
Where's a hot

276
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
flash when you

277
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
need one?

278
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
Pretty funny

279
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
since we both

280
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,435
were 50+.

281
00:00:13,435 --> 00:00:13,814
We instantly

282
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:13,886
formed a

283
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:14,146
camaraderie of

284
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
misery.

285
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
*A good laugh

286
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
over something

287
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
unexpected,

288
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
it's like a

289
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
moment when

290
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
you both find

291
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
something

292
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
funny at the

293
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
same time.

294
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
It breaks the

295
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
ice and

296
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
creates an

297
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
instant

298
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
connection,

299
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
making it feel

300
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
like you've

301
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
known each

302
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
other for much

303
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,146
longer than a

304
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:14,476
few

305
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:14,476
minutes.What

306
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:14,586
is the one

307
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:14,586
thing you

308
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:14,616
would never

309
00:00:14,616 --> 00:00:15,118
say

310
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
NO

311
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
to?

312
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*A paid day

313
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
off...

314
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*a day off

315
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*A nap

316
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*A breath mint

317
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
or gum.

318
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
If it's being

319
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
offered,

320
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
chances are

321
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
there's a

322
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
reason.

323
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*Pizza

324
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*Money

325
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
*Flowers,

326
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,118
hope I receive

327
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:15,328
one before I

328
00:00:15,328 --> 00:00:15,348
die

329
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:15,348
*My wife asking

330
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:15,348
for us time

331
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:15,348
*A hug

332
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:15,348
*ice cream

333
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:15,361
*Head
