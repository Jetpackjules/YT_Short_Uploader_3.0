00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:02,537
What is the safest answer when your girlfriend

2
00:00:02,597 --> 00:00:04,035
asks if her friend is hot?

3
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:07,152
Question Mark. I've never looked at her like

4
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,590
that before, removed.

5
00:00:09,164 --> 00:00:11,242
Say, no. But she's an awesome kiss her.

6
00:00:11,562 --> 00:00:13,240
Yes. I would love you if you were

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,558
a worm. Yeah. Why. You interested in her?

8
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:18,675
No hap Ing, in an overly enthusiastic tone,

9
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,080
Why did she ask about me? Can't lose.

10
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:23,072
An ex pulled this on me regarding her

11
00:00:23,072 --> 00:00:25,541
best friend. My response, she's alright, but her

12
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,453
best friend is damn sexy. Is not as

13
00:00:27,453 --> 00:00:29,223
hot as your mom. Never thought about it,

14
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:31,700
but did you know the Roman Empire roadway

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,778
is the reason railway tracks are the size

16
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:36,175
they are today? Not my most challenging wink.

17
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:38,585
I literally start singing, I only have eyes

18
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:41,219
for you. I'm a terrible singer. After 2

19
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,534
versus, the conversation is over, and she has

20
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:45,945
left the room. You have friends? I said,

21
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:47,465
I know where you're going with this, and

22
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,784
I absolutely refused to have a threes with

23
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,960
your friend. I love you too much. How

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,719
did I do? You sq like a little

25
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,600
girl and shout ugg girls and then shutter.
