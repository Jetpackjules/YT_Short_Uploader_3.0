1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,374
What screams “I have depression”?

2
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:05,540
completely tired all the time,
even when you don’t do

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,104
anythingSleeping to avoid living.

4
00:00:08,104 --> 00:00:11,980
Even if you’re not necessarily
tired.Constantly in a world in your

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,694
head.

6
00:00:12,694 --> 00:00:14,830
I struggle with living like this.

7
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,601
My mind and body are normally never in
the same place.Intense irritation at

8
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:23,700
small things.Feeling like it’s a chore
to do things that you used to love

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,480
doing.Snoozing for an eternity because
you know what awaits you when you get up

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,373
and face the day.I was driving,
as I frequently do for work,

11
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:36,594
and realized I didn't have Spotify
or the radio on.

12
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,000
I am a music nut.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,520
I had been driving that way for hours.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,420
Thought back and had multiple
days like that.

15
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,798
Just wasn't interested in it.

16
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:50,600
That was weirdly a big wake
up call for me.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,681
**EDIT:** This blew up way more than I
thought it would, so I thought I would

18
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:01,020
clarify since this is getting
a lot of exposure.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,053
Not listening to music is in NO way a
sure-fire diagnosis for depression.

20
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:12,344
Even in my most mentally-healthy phases,
there is definitely times when I drive/

21
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:15,960
cook/hang out in silence at times.

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,796
That's normal.

23
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:21,120
What isn't normal is that I've been
listening to music since I was really

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,446
young, and really got into it when I
was like 9-10.

25
00:01:25,446 --> 00:01:27,860
Music is probably my main hobby.

26
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,890
In a job where I'm on the road for
anywhere from 30 mins to 6 hours a day,

27
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:39,002
I listen to music all the time when I'm
not on the phone for work.

28
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:44,140
One day, I had been driving for several
hours, and just felt... numb.

29
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,480
I had a realization that no music was
playing- this got me thinking about how

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,340
long this had been going on,
and I realized I had been driving like

31
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,328
this for a few weeks now.

32
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:59,260
I also love to cook and listen to music-
I'll sing along, make up lyrics,

33
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,095
sing to my son, and generally have fun.

34
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,186
I had stopped doing this as well.

35
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:08,360
I was already growing concerned about
depression, so I discussed this with my

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,520
psychologist/therapist and PCP.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,500
They both agreed, after several
discussions, that I am clinically

38
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,080
depressed and that not having interest
in things you once loved is definitely

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,596
a sign of depression.

40
00:02:21,596 --> 00:02:25,346
So it was one of the first real "wake-
up" calls for me.
