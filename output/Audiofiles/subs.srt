1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:02,374
What screams �I have depression�?

2
00:00:02,374 --> 00:00:05,500
completely tired all the time,
even when you don�t do

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,520
anythingConstantly in a
world in your head.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,656
I struggle with living like this.

5
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:15,830
My mind and body are normally never in
the same place.Sleeping to avoid living.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,009
Even if you�re not necessarily
tired.Intense irritation at small

7
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:23,775
things.Feeling like it�s a chore to do
things that you used to love

8
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:28,480
doing.Snoozing for an eternity because
you know what awaits you when you get up

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,373
and face the day.I was driving,
as I frequently do for work,

10
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:36,594
and realized I didn't have Spotify
or the radio on.

11
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:38,000
I am a music nut.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,520
I had been driving that way for hours.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,039
Thought back and had multiple
days like that.

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,060
&#x200B;

15
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,798
Just wasn't interested in it.

16
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:49,460
That was weirdly a big wake
up call for me.

17
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,309
&#x200B;

18
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:56,681
**EDIT:** This blew up way more than I
thought it would, so I thought I would

19
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,143
clarify since this is getting
a lot of exposure.

20
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,147
&#x200B;

21
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:07,032
Not listening to music is in NO way a
sure-fire diagnosis for depression.

22
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:12,259
Even in my most mentally-healthy phases,
there is definitely times when I drive/

23
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:14,728
cook/hang out in silence at times.

24
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:15,740
That's normal.

25
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,754
&#x200B;

26
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:21,060
What isn't normal is that I've been
listening to music since I was really

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,404
young, and really got into it when I
was like 9-10.

28
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:27,797
Music is probably my main hobby.

29
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:32,827
In a job where I'm on the road for
anywhere from 30 mins to 6 hours a day,

30
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:36,922
I listen to music all the time when I'm
not on the phone for work.

31
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,938
&#x200B;

32
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:44,069
One day, I had been driving for several
hours, and just felt... numb.

33
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,422
I had a realization that no music was
playing- this got me thinking about how

34
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:52,280
long this had been going on,
and I realized I had been driving like

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,266
this for a few weeks now.

36
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:59,217
I also love to cook and listen to music-
I'll sing along, make up lyrics,

37
00:01:59,217 --> 00:02:02,031
sing to my son, and generally have fun.

38
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:04,120
I had stopped doing this as well.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,280
I was already growing concerned about
depression, so I discussed this with my

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,451
psychologist/therapist and PCP.

41
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:15,439
They both agreed, after several
discussions, that I am clinically

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,039
depressed and that not having interest
in things you once loved is definitely

43
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,532
a sign of depression.

44
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:25,268
So it was one of the first real "wake-
up" calls for me.
