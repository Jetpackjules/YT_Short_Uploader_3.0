9
00:00:04,716 --> 00:00:05,719
*This isn't exactly

10
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:06,850
advice but my dad

11
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,500
used to talk to me

12
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,109
and send me stuff

13
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:08,739
about all these

14
00:00:08,739 --> 00:00:09,500
cool technological

15
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,099
breakthroughs.

16
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:10,635
I can remember

17
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:11,256
things like smart

18
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:11,840
roads, and

19
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,800
Crisper, and new

20
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,500
solar panel

21
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,120
efficiency.

22
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,570
And we would talk

23
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,009
about the new

24
00:00:15,009 --> 00:00:15,400
fusion

25
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:15,930
breakthroughs and

26
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,629
just cutting-edge

27
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:17,182
stuff that I like

28
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:17,820
to read about.

29
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,602
So, my dad died

30
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,230
about 6 months

31
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,989
ago, suddenly and

32
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:20,222
awful and me and

33
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:20,425
my siblings were

34
00:00:20,425 --> 00:00:20,940
talking, and we

35
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,260
realized he did

36
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:21,380
the same thing to

37
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:21,786
them, but more

38
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:22,140
suited to their

39
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,349
interests.

40
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:23,100
My sister was all

41
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,968
medical stuff,

42
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:24,611
and my brother was

43
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:25,397
all sports.

44
00:00:25,397 --> 00:00:26,130
We didn't realize

45
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,899
until after he was

46
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:27,710
gone that my dad

47
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,390
used to research

48
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,960
and read about his

49
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,340
children's

50
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,199
interests so he

51
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,666
would have stuff

52
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:31,250
to talk about with

53
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:31,591
us.

54
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,149
And it kinda

55
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:32,819
wrecked me.

56
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:33,620
My dad was always

57
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,490
great, but we

58
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,159
never realized

59
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,810
just how great he

60
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,250
was.

61
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:36,820
So I guess the

62
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,500
advice was,

63
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,014
Get to know your

64
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:38,606
kids.

65
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,137
Share in their

66
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:40,412
interests.

67
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,369
*This is not mine

68
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:41,810
but something I

69
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,219
read somewhere But

70
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,020
essentially a girl

71
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,736
was practicing

72
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:45,329
archery and kept

73
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:46,030
messing up and the

74
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,710
instructor told

75
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,451
her

76
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:47,909
You're failing

77
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:48,429
because you're too

78
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:48,966
focused on the

79
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,540
target and not

80
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,753
your own actions

81
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:51,359
She proceeded to

82
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:51,859
say that it was

83
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,450
the best life

84
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:52,929
advice she had

85
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:53,943
ever gotten.
