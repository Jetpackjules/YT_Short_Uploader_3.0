6
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:03,985
*C++

7
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:04,391
*Spanish

8
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:05,037
honestly comes

9
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:05,691
most in handy

10
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:06,177
where I've

11
00:00:06,177 --> 00:00:06,997
been

12
00:00:06,997 --> 00:00:07,473
*Sign Language

13
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:07,713
would be

14
00:00:07,713 --> 00:00:08,852
pretty handy

15
00:00:08,852 --> 00:00:09,442
*Ancient

16
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,105
archaic

17
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:11,428
Sumerian

18
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:11,626
👍 One of the

19
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:12,238
most important

20
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:12,456
early

21
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,387
civilisations,

22
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:13,736
pre-dating

23
00:00:13,736 --> 00:00:14,097
Ancient

24
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:14,644
Egypt..

25
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:15,226
the Sumerian

26
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:15,576
language is

27
00:00:15,576 --> 00:00:16,016
mostly a

28
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,074
mystery to us,

29
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:17,387
as there are

30
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:17,907
no similar

31
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:18,318
languages

32
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:18,660
found to

33
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:18,978
cross-

34
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:19,431
reference it

35
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,238
with.

36
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:20,764
So despite

37
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:21,160
being one of

38
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,470
the most

39
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:21,880
important

40
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,580
civilisations

41
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,517
in history,

42
00:00:23,517 --> 00:00:24,090
almost all of

43
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,611
their records

44
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:25,040
and writings

45
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,249
are unknown.

46
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:26,631
So I would

47
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:27,122
instantly

48
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:27,753
learn Ancient

49
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:28,468
Sumerian,

50
00:00:28,468 --> 00:00:29,003
thus becoming

51
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:29,343
the single

52
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:29,914
authority on

53
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:30,274
Sumerian

54
00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:31,176
language.

55
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:31,695
This would not

56
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:32,239
only make me

57
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:32,765
fabulously

58
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:33,286
rich and

59
00:00:33,286 --> 00:00:33,865
famous,

60
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:34,346
but would also

61
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:34,865
bring huge

62
00:00:34,865 --> 00:00:35,315
amounts of

63
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:35,919
knowledge and

64
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:36,226
ancient

65
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:36,675
history to

66
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:36,835
light

67
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:37,043
enriching the

68
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:38,923
world 🙌
