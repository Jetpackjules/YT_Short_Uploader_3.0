00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:03,259
To those who have accidentally killed
someone, what went wrong?

2
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:06,880
My. dad. is. a \n garbage truck driver
in a major city.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,676
A few years ago, there was a dead and
crushed homeless man found at the dump.

4
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:15,259
They went through the camera footage and
the tickets for the trucks coming and

5
00:00:15,259 --> 00:00:19,179
going and narrowed it down to my dad's
truck who dumped the man.

6
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,426
The guy was sleeping in a dumpster.

7
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:24,780
For those of you that don't know,
there's a packer blade in the back of

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,192
those trucks to squish the garbage
to make more room.

9
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:33,231
He didn't stand a chance.No,
but I thought I did for almost 2 years.

10
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,960
Very close friend of mine,
the kind of guy that always seemed to be

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,498
happy and everybody just loved him.

12
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:44,762
Was hanging out at his place (we were 16
back then) and for whatever reason I don

13
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:48,357
�t remember, I showed him how to tie
the hangman�s knot.

14
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:50,322
3 days later he was dead.

15
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:54,458
His mom called, claiming he hung himself
and it was all my fault.

16
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:55,785
Fucked me up badly.

17
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:59,359
My friend was dead, I never saw anything
coming and apparently it

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,141
was even my fault�

19
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:05,640
Almost 2 years later we found out by
coincidence, that he killed himself with

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,980
exhaust fumes in his mom�s car.

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:12,800
I�ll never know, why he did it (which
still haunts me sometimes) or why his

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,665
mom blamed me with wrong accusations
(never could be angry about that though,

23
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:20,959
given how painful that must have been
for her) or how she knew

24
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,678
about that stupid knot�
