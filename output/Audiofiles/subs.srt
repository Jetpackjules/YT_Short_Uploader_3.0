1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:02,433
What would instantly destroy your life just by

2
00:00:02,433 --> 00:00:03,071
doing it once?

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,465
As an older guy in the trades.

4
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:08,748
Fuck around with safety, I've seen enough people

5
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:11,158
fuck their livelihood up by taking a stupid

6
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:12,171
unnecessary chance.

7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,638
It's always a shame when you hear of

8
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:16,969
a young trade person died because you know

9
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:17,850
they probably don't.

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,489
No better or didn't work with people who

11
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,250
were teaching them how to do it safely.

12
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,898
Number 1 rule is come home at the

13
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:25,696
end of each day.

14
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,205
Reconnecting with people who are bad influences on

15
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:31,678
you. You'd be surprised how quick 1 can

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:32,770
return to their old ways

17
00:00:33,848 --> 00:00:36,026
For and picking mushrooms you cannot

18
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:39,921
identify. Ne and homicide, I'm sure self defense

19
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,847
killings are not as difficult to handle as

20
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:42,665
it is justified.

21
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,218
Not saying everyone would be fine, but ne

22
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:49,332
in homicide is another level. You drive drunk,

23
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,432
text while driving, or not pay attention and

24
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:53,625
smack into a pedestrian.

25
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:56,058
You're going to live in a nightmare and
