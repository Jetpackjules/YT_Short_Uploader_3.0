8
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:04,700
*My younger

9
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,009
brother

10
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:05,500
decided to be

11
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,110
a train hopper

12
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:06,570
for roughly

13
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,229
half the year

14
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:07,660
so he doesn't

15
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,151
have to pay

16
00:00:08,151 --> 00:00:09,155
for rent.

17
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:09,800
*I remember

18
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,110
reading a

19
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,650
story about a

20
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,305
guy who had an

21
00:00:11,305 --> 00:00:11,950
internship at

22
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,620
some big tech

23
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,260
firm, I think

24
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,570
Google,

25
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:13,740
in an

26
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,109
extremely HCOL

27
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:16,118
area.

28
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:16,539
He bought an

29
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:17,492
old uhaul and

30
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:18,030
outfitted it

31
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,231
for living.

32
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:19,640
He parked in

33
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,100
the company

34
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,480
lot as

35
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,185
obscurely as

36
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:21,769
possible and

37
00:00:21,769 --> 00:00:22,390
moved every so

38
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,612
often.

39
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:23,990
Used the

40
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,320
company

41
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,879
showers and

42
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,030
such.

43
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,489
Probably the

44
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:27,000
best way to

45
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,420
manage that

46
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,050
situation if

47
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:28,230
you could

48
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,270
handle it.

49
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:29,839
*I had a friend

50
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,221
who would go

51
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:30,579
to farmer's

52
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,300
markets and

53
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:31,769
wait until the

54
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:32,135
end of the

55
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:33,090
day, then go

56
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,906
up to people

57
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:34,460
and offer to

58
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:34,670
buy the

59
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,329
leftovers at a

60
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:35,981
discount.

61
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:36,689
Not terribly

62
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:37,343
exciting,

63
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:38,087
but bold.
