00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:04,903
*How many times

9
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:05,733
I almost died

10
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:05,923
and didn't

11
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,634
even realize

12
00:00:06,634 --> 00:00:07,225
it

13
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:07,755
*How often the

14
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:08,309
embarrassing

15
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:08,825
thing I said

16
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:09,065
that I

17
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:09,544
couldn't stop

18
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:10,064
thinking about

19
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:10,775
for weeks was

20
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:11,155
actually

21
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:12,006
noticed

22
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:12,446
*On how many

23
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,106
random photos

24
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:13,676
I ended up by

25
00:00:13,676 --> 00:00:14,800
accident.

26
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,368
*Individuals I

27
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:16,128
affected in a

28
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,079
positive way.

29
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:17,416
*How many

30
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:17,901
people I have

31
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:18,319
genuinely

32
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,249
helped vs how

33
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:19,719
many people I

34
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:20,691
genuinely hurt

35
00:00:20,691 --> 00:00:21,119
which I never

36
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,312
intended.

reading a lot

39
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,420
for decades.

40
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:24,844
I sometimes

41
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:25,514
wonder exactly

42
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:25,944
how many books

43
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:26,996
I've read.

*Jokes landed

45
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:28,358

what my most

47
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,137
used words are

48
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:30,581
*I'm curious

49
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,041
about my

50
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:31,378
Wasted

53
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:33,116
see how many

54
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:33,628
times I made

55
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:34,371
someone smile

56
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:35,135
or laugh.
