8
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,330
*When I was 17,

9
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,121
my boyfriend

10
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:03,541
at the time

11
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,261
invited me to

12
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:04,971
backyard camp

13
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:05,111
at his

14
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:05,231
friend's

15
00:00:05,231 --> 00:00:05,441
house.

16
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:05,761
I knew the

17
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:06,131
friend,

18
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:06,291
he was super

19
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:06,561
chill, so I

20
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:06,761
said yes.

21
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:07,421
Got there,

22
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:07,961
some awesome

23
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:08,341
tents were set

24
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:08,491
up in the

25
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:09,091
yard, grill

26
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:09,892
was going,

27
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:10,321
there was a

28
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:10,761
giant cooler

29
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:11,252
of drinks,

30
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:11,765
I brought

31
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:12,252
snacks.

32
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:13,152
Everything was

33
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:13,252
pretty

34
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:13,842
awesome.

35
00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:14,162
His parents

36
00:00:14,162 --> 00:00:14,732
were so nice,

37
00:00:14,732 --> 00:00:15,332
his younger

38
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,242
siblings came

39
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:16,462
and played

40
00:00:16,462 --> 00:00:16,792
games with us,

41
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:17,652
it was great.

42
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:18,382
At one point I

43
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:19,022
asked to go to

44
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:19,722
the bathroom,

45
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:20,062
so he showed

46
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:20,612
me inside.

47
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:21,112
It was so

48
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:21,582
crawling with

49
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:22,272
roaches,

50
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,352
everything

51
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:23,038
looked like it

52
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:23,564
was moving.

53
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:24,514
In my 5 minutes

54
00:00:24,514 --> 00:00:24,864
inside,

55
00:00:24,864 --> 00:00:25,434
I had to swat

56
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:25,994
them off me

57
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:26,464
every 30

58
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:27,134
seconds.

59
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:27,544
His parents and

60
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:27,804
siblings were

61
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:28,314
just sitting

62
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:28,594
around like

63
00:00:28,594 --> 00:00:29,054
nothing was

64
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:29,304
wrong.

65
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:29,844
My skin crawled

66
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:30,344
for the rest

67
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:30,854
of the night.

68
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:31,124
Needless to

69
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:32,194
say, I never

70
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:32,474
went

71
00:00:32,474 --> 00:00:33,254
back.Which

72
00:00:33,254 --> 00:00:33,294
celebrity do

73
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:33,474
you think has

74
00:00:33,474 --> 00:00:33,514
a lot of

75
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:33,534
skeletons in

76
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,144
their closet?

77
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:35,264
*Sean Combs.

78
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
I know he's in

79
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
trouble for a

80
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
thing, but I

81
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
think it's

82
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
just the tip

83
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
of the

84
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
iceberg.

85
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Jimâ€“Bob Duggar

86
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Anyone who was

87
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
or is a

88
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
scientologist.

89
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
I read Leah

90
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
ReminI's book.

91
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Holy cow.

92
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Jared Leto.

93
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Kris Jenner

94
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Tom cruise

95
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
...it's wild

96
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
to me this man

97
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
pretty much

98
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
has nothing to

99
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
do with his

100
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
daughter who

101
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
seems like

102
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
such a sweet

103
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
girl.

104
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Going to Paris

105
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
to root for

106
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Simone Biles

107
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
but no where

108
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
to be seen at

109
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
SirI's

110
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
graduation?

111
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Wow

112
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Joel Osteen

113
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Tom CruiseWhat

114
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
often destroys

115
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
relationships

116
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
but is hardly

117
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
talked about?

118
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Silent

119
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
resentment.

120
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Those unspoken

121
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
grudges build

122
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
up over time

123
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
like dust

124
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
bunnies under

125
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
the bed,

126
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
and one day

127
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
they just

128
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
explode all

129
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
over the

130
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
place!!

131
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Lack of

132
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
appreciation.

133
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
When you stop

134
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
noticing the

135
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
little things

136
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
your partner

137
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
does, it can

138
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
slowly erode

139
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
the connection

140
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
without anyone

141
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
even realizing

142
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
it!!!

143
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Health.

144
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Beating around

145
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
the bush and

146
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
making the

147
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
other read

148
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
between the

149
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
lines.

150
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Just say it.

151
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
*Lack of fun.

152
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
I know

153
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
relationships

154
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
arent always

155
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
easy.

156
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
Work to do,

157
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
baggage to

158
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
deal with,

159
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
real life

160
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
issues,

161
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
differing

162
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
goals.

163
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
But man,

164
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
once the fun

165
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
stops, what's

166
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
the point of

167
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
going through

168
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
the motions?

169
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
You can just do

170
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
it solo as

171
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,264
well at such

172
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:35,266
point.
