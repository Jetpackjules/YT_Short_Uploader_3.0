7
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,370
*when he fired

8
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,121
his secretary

9
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:05,360
who's been

10
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,923
loyal to him

11
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:06,290
for years

12
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:06,719
after she

13
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,120
asked for a

14
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,089
raise

15
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,227
*Quite honestly

16
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:09,660
- the turning

17
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,029
point was

18
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:10,580
immediately

19
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:10,869
after I

20
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:11,250
started to

21
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,120
like him.

22
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,660
As I was

23
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,029
starting to

24
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:13,369
like him,

25
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,332
even.

26
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:14,933
The problem is

27
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:15,429
that once you

28
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:15,939
learn anything

29
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:16,529
about him,

30
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,000
you realize

31
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,190
what a

32
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,000
miserable sack

33
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,489
of wasted

34
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:19,755
flesh he is.

35
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:20,329
Once you start

36
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:20,769
looking into

37
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:21,160
his social

38
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,488
media

39
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,040
presence,

40
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,480
the reality

41
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:22,820
becomes

42
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,399
literally

43
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,584
unavoidable.

44
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:25,330
So I thought

45
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,149
hey, that Musk

46
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:26,510
guy with the

47
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,194
solar panels

48
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:27,629
seems like he

49
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:28,070
might be onto

50
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,460
something,

51
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,120
and then one

52
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,589
google search

53
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:30,039
later I

54
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:30,620
realized I had

55
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,679
been wrong.

56
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,189
This was quite

57
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:33,061
a while ago,

58
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:33,326
so his

59
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:33,659
personal

60
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,100
opinions

61
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:34,496
weren't yet

62
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:34,829
plastered

63
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:35,658
everywhere.
