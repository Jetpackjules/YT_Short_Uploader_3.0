00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,599
*My aunt before

7
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:00,820
cancer vs

8
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:00,953
shortly after

9
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:01,229
dying No

10
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:02,080
amount of dead

11
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,580
people on TV

12
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:02,714
or the

13
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:02,724
internet

14
00:00:02,724 --> 00:00:03,161
prepares you

15
00:00:03,161 --> 00:00:03,221
for seeing it

16
00:00:03,221 --> 00:00:03,353
in person

17
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:04,201
*I went to

18
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:04,597
elementary

19
00:00:04,597 --> 00:00:05,121
school with a

20
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:05,291
kid who was a

21
00:00:05,291 --> 00:00:05,471
little chubby,

22
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:05,861
on the shorter

23
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:06,062
side, wore

24
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:06,131
glasses,

25
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:06,131
didn't really

26
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:06,341
dress in a way

27
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:06,391
that was

28
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:06,391
considered

29
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:06,391
cool

30
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:06,391
and was kind of

31
00:00:06,391 --> 00:00:06,852
bullied by

32
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:06,931
other kids

33
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:07,212
sometimes.

34
00:00:07,212 --> 00:00:07,382
I always felt

35
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:07,496
bad for him

36
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:07,730
because he was

37
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:07,762
nice and I

38
00:00:07,762 --> 00:00:07,822
heard some

39
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:08,011
things about

40
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:08,242
his family

41
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:08,742
situation from

42
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:08,934
a girl who

43
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:09,293
lived on his

44
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:09,452
street,

45
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:09,452
and allegedly

46
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:09,452
he was

47
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:09,462
physically

48
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:09,472
abused by his

49
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,506
stepdad.

50
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:10,546
Didn't see him

51
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:10,546
for years

52
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:10,546
after 8th

53
00:00:10,546 --> 00:00:10,796
grade and then

54
00:00:10,796 --> 00:00:10,996
ran into him

55
00:00:10,996 --> 00:00:11,196
while I was in

56
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:11,236
the Marines,

57
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:11,646
but home on

58
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:11,796
leave when we

59
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:12,173
were 18 or 19.

60
00:00:12,173 --> 00:00:12,246
He was also in

61
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:12,696
the Marines &

62
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:13,226
home on leave

63
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:13,396
as well,

64
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:13,516
so were

65
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:13,683
hanging out

66
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:13,706
one night &

67
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:13,729
bonding over

68
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:13,916
that.

69
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:14,613
Anyway, I

70
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:14,647
totally didn't

71
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:14,647
recognize him

72
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:14,647
at all when I

73
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:14,647
first ran

74
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:14,657
intoh im.

75
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:14,657
He'd gotten

76
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:14,917
tall, shed the

77
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:15,437
extra pounds,

78
00:00:15,437 --> 00:00:15,647
was completely

79
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:15,737
jacked,

80
00:00:15,737 --> 00:00:16,197
and his arms

81
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:16,467
were covered

82
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:16,868
in tattoos.

83
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:17,108
If he wasn't

84
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:17,318
such a nice

85
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:17,569
guy, he'd have

86
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:17,631
looked

87
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:17,648
intimidating.We

88
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:17,649
all know

89
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:17,719
examples of

90
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:18,762
tropes that

91
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:18,792
makes it clear

92
00:00:18,792 --> 00:00:18,812
that a male

93
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:18,852
author is

94
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,032
writing a

95
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:19,033
female

96
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:19,202
character,

97
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:19,220
but what are

98
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,635
some that make

99
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:19,782
it obvious

100
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:19,802
that a female

101
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:19,802
author it

102
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:19,802
writing a male

103
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:20,246
character?

104
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:20,880
*Female authors

105
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,032
seem to

106
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:21,422
describe the

107
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:21,422
color of a

108
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:21,422
man's hair

109
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:21,532
much more than

110
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:21,964
male authors.

111
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
Particularly if

112
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
it is graying.

113
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
*Ways I'd

114
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
romantically

115
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
describe my 50

116
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
year old

117
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
husbands eyes.

118
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
His eyes are

119
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
sullen blue,

120
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
like a winter

121
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
morning,

122
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
with flecks of

123
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
metallic grey

124
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
they remind me

125
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
of his steel

126
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
town origins.

127
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
In the summer,

128
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
their blueness

129
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
becomes deeper

130
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
and richer,

131
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
like a topaz.

132
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
Way he

133
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
describes his

134
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
eyes.

135
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
Blue I think.

136
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
I dunno.

137
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
Are they still

138
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
blue or

139
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
something?

140
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
I mean, do they

141
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
change and

142
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
that with age?

143
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
Wait..are they

144
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
blue?

145
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
What's the

146
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
creepiest

147
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
thing a member

148
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
of your family

149
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
has ever said?

150
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
*My little

151
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
sister toddler

152
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
at the time

153
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
needed to have

154
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
a small

155
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
surgery.

156
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
They were at

157
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
the check in

158
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
with the

159
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
doctor and she

160
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
was playing

161
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
with toys.

162
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
During a break

163
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
in the adult's

164
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
conversation,

165
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
they heard my

166
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
sister have

167
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
one doll say

168
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
to the other,

169
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
this is my dad.

170
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
He hits me

171
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
allll the

172
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
time.

173
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
My dad did not

174
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
hit us.

175
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
The doctor had

176
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
to ask a few

177
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
very awkward

178
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:21,964
questions to

179
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:22,104
get it sorted.

180
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:22,674
*I had an uncle

181
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:23,254
buy me silk

182
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:23,735
underwear for

183
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:24,378
my 16th

184
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:25,130
birthday and

185
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:25,695
when I opened

186
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:26,325
it said

187
00:00:26,325 --> 00:00:26,755
you should try

188
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:27,125
it on right

189
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:28,424
now

190
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:28,969
*I was

191
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:29,139
babysitting my

192
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:29,439
nephew

193
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,339
overnight and

194
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:30,831
he told me

195
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:31,109
there was

196
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,589
people on the

197
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:32,489
