4
00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:02,690
*Leaving a

5
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:03,240
toxic work

6
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,334
environment.

7
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:04,931
*If only I'd

8
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:05,501
realized this

9
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:06,607
in my teens.

10
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,441
People severely

11
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,261
undererstimate

12
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:08,429
what a

13
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:08,951
tremendous

14
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:09,691
impact sleep

15
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,111
has on your

16
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:10,763
day,

17
00:00:10,763 --> 00:00:11,735
productivity,

18
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:14,303
mood...etc

19
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:14,763
*Quit teaching

20
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:15,446
high school.

21
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:16,226
Got divorced.

22
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:16,773
So much less

23
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:17,213
stress I

24
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:17,763
finally quit

25
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:18,757
smoking.

26
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,427
*I'm just here

27
00:00:20,427 --> 00:00:21,613
furiously

28
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:23,111
taking notes

29
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:23,501
*Learning to

30
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:24,331
love myself.

31
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:24,811
A few years

32
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:25,992
ago, I was in

33
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:26,502
a very low

34
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:27,062
spot with my

35
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:28,284
self esteem,

36
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:28,713
and I wanted

37
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:29,685
to be better.

38
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:30,324
My therapist

39
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:30,884
and I talked a

40
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:31,304
lot about

41
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:31,554
treating

42
00:00:31,554 --> 00:00:32,264
myself like I

43
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:32,444
would a

44
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:33,348
friend.

45
00:00:33,348 --> 00:00:33,735
It sounds

46
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:34,625
cheesy,

47
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:35,285
but I started

48
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:35,535
writing

49
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,095
compliments to

50
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:36,865
myself on post

51
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:37,205
it notes in

52
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:37,915
the morning

53
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:38,525
and placing

54
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:38,865
them on a

55
00:00:38,865 --> 00:00:39,727
mirror.

56
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:40,267
It didn't take

57
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:40,696
too long

58
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:41,006
before I

59
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:41,466
started to

60
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,093
believe them.

61
00:00:42,093 --> 00:00:42,796
It's amazing

62
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:43,656
how being nice

63
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:44,530
to yourself

64
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:44,836
and giving

65
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:45,952
yourself grace

66
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:46,496
can really

67
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,076
improve your

68
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:48,249
mental health.
