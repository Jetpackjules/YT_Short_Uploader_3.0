5
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,296
*Food from food

6
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:04,820
trucks.

7
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,440
I'm not spending

8
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,531
$15 for a grilled

9
00:00:06,531 --> 00:00:07,082
cheese that I have

10
00:00:07,082 --> 00:00:07,469
to wait in the

11
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,929
rain for.

12
00:00:08,929 --> 00:00:10,263
*McDonald's.

13
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:11,509
Wtf happened to the

14
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:12,909
dollar menu?!

15
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:13,429
There ain't nothing

16
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:13,862
on there that

17
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,279
costs a dollar.

18
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,129
*Mobile apps.

19
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm absolutely

20
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,640
infuriatingly

21
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,057
tired of

22
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:18,640
subscription

23
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,411
services.

24
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,051
The worst is that

25
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:20,390
they let you

26
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,340
download the app

27
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,940
so they can claim

28
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,916
it as a download,

29
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:23,412
only to get

30
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:24,081
stonewalled by a

31
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:25,125
subscription page.

32
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:25,910
Let's go back to a

33
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,630
one time fee

34
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,470
please.

35
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,299
*At this rate,

36
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:29,645
shelter and food.

37
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:30,404
*Subway.

38
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:31,160
Even the 6 inch

39
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,556
subs are over $7

40
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:33,367
before chips and

41
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,369
soda.

42
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,250
*I never buy chips

43
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:35,619
unless they're

44
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,259
some kind of BOGO.

45
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:37,890
*It's pretty damn

46
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:38,710
expensive just to

47
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,959
exist right now.

48
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:40,799
*Frozen Pizzas are

49
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,450
reaching the point

50
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:41,909
of being more

51
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:42,530
expensive than

52
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,521
real pizza.
