*An Uber home

7
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:05,605
instead of a

00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,261
DUI.

9
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:06,670
Whether it's

court costs,

11
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:08,089
the more than

00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,243
monetary costs

13
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:09,380

accident,

15
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:10,779
and the issue

16
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:11,150
of having a

17
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:11,589

19
00:00:12,217 --> 00:00:12,801
It's not worth

20
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:13,910
it, don't
