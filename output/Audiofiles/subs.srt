7
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:03,872
*Be nice

8
00:00:03,872 --> 00:00:04,120
because you

9
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,791
want to,

10
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:05,180
not because

11
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,400
you want a

12
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,704
reward.

13
00:00:06,704 --> 00:00:07,132
*Stop looking

14
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:07,644
at women as a

15
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:08,717
transaction.

16
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:08,903
You are

17
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:09,423
specifically

18
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:10,121
being nice and

19
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:10,559
expecting

20
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:10,873
things in

21
00:00:10,873 --> 00:00:12,152
return.

22
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:12,486
If you are a

23
00:00:12,486 --> 00:00:13,324
nice person,

24
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:13,686
be nice to

25
00:00:13,686 --> 00:00:14,591
everyone.

26
00:00:14,591 --> 00:00:15,017
Treat people

27
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:15,200
you are

28
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,744
interested in

29
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:16,187
as human

30
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:16,752
beings,

31
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:17,027
treat them

32
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:17,347
like you would

33
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:17,870
a friend,

34
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,147
and most

35
00:00:18,147 --> 00:00:18,850
importantly,

36
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,277
respect their

37
00:00:19,277 --> 00:00:20,501
boundaries and

38
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:20,990
if they reject

39
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,785
you, move on.

40
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:23,115
*To quote

41
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:23,955
Sondheim,

42
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:24,420
Nice is

43
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:24,870
different than

44
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,568
Good.

45
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:25,955
The difference

46
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:26,513
is that Nice

47
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:27,217
guys are nice

48
00:00:27,217 --> 00:00:27,545
because they

49
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:27,845
want

50
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:28,758
something.

51
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:29,268
Good guys are

52
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:29,864
nice because

53
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:30,128
that's the

54
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:30,574
right way to

55
00:00:30,574 --> 00:00:31,318
treat people,

56
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:31,756
whether or not

57
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:31,948
they have

58
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:32,338
something you

59
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:33,143
want.

60
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,223
Be a Good guy.

61
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:34,855
Be kind and

62
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:35,646
considerate,

63
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:35,970
with no

64
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,640
expectation of

65
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,010
anything in

66
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,822
return.

67
00:00:37,822 --> 00:00:38,826
Be authentic

68
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:39,571
and open about

69
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,914
who you are.

70
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:41,386
If a woman

71
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:41,962
isn't into

72
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:42,472
you, that's a

73
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:43,123
good thing

74
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:43,462
because it

75
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:43,832
means she

76
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:44,319
wasn't a good

77
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:44,752
fit for you

78
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:45,434
anyway.

79
00:00:45,434 --> 00:00:45,852
When a woman is

80
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:46,623
into you,

81
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:46,993
it means she

82
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:47,583
likes you for

83
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:48,228
you, and not

84
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:48,613
just because

85
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:49,999
you were Nice.
