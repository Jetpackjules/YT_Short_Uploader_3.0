*A quality and

7
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,551
comfortable

8
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:06,897
sofa or couch

9
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:07,474
Good dental

10
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:07,894
care and

11
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:08,731
braces is well

12
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,572
wroth it to me

13
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:10,281
But for safety

14
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:11,021
I would say

15
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:11,782
quality tires

16
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:12,992
is a must

17
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:13,772
*Paying movers

18
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:14,402
when moving

19
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:14,882
into a new

20
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:15,850
place.

21
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,757
*A good pillow

22
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:16,907
and a

23
00:00:16,907 --> 00:00:17,243
comfortable

24
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:18,370
mattress

25
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:18,876
*Impacted

26
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:19,517
wisdom teeth

27
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:20,281
out

28
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:20,916
*For me it was

29
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:22,237
lasik surgery.

30
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:22,913
*My polarized

31
00:00:22,913 --> 00:00:23,327

sunglasses.

33
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:25,177
Pricey but so

34
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:25,767
worth it,

35
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:26,177
especially

36
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:26,621
since I love

37
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:27,603
to fish.

38
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:28,098
Feels like I

39
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:28,748
have xray

40
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:29,414
vision when I

41
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:29,978
look at the

42
00:00:29,978 --> 00:00:31,008
water.
