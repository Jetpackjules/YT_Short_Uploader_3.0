00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,080
resort in

00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,919
Jamaica.

11
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:06,441
Every night

12
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:06,853
they had this

13
00:00:06,853 --> 00:00:07,580
common area

14
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,134
where folks

15
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:08,474
could do

16
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:09,574
karaoke.

17
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:10,240
A middle-aged

18
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,789
gentleman got

19
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:11,500
up and started

20
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,009
the first few

21
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:12,500
lines of

22
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,849
Lionel

00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:13,759
Richie's

24
00:00:13,759 --> -1:59:59,000
Easy

25
-1:59:59,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

26
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:14,890
Some random

27
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,419
lady from the

28
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:16,000
audience ran

29
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,250
up and

30
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:16,949
attempted to

31
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,679
sing the song

32
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:17,890
with the

33
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,882
gentleman.

34
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:19,454
He kindly

35
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:19,789
pushed her

36
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:20,449
away two or

37
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:21,160
three times as

38
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,660
she tried to

39
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,230
sing over his

40
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,739
shoulder into

41
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:22,879
the

42
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,946
microphone.

43
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:24,658
Finally,

44
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:25,320
she just stood

45
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,449
there

46
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:26,689
dejected...

47
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:27,370
swaying from

48
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,464
side to side

49
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:29,492
like an idiot

50
00:00:29,492 --> 00:00:29,970
- as the man

51
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,440
broke from his

52
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,899
song and

53
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,350
professed his

54
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,839
love for his

55
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,748
girlfriend

56
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:33,159
- and wrapped

57
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:33,609
up with a

58
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:33,956
marriage

59
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:35,027
proposal.

60
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:35,879
They hugged,

61
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,199
they kissed...

62
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:38,500
the idiot girl

63
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:38,990
went back to

64
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,049
her seat.

65
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:40,590
I will still

66
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:40,880
never

67
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,600
understand why

68
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,320
that guy chose

69
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,020
THAT song to

70
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,398
use to

71
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:44,675
propose.

72
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:45,445
However,

73
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,280
he was killing

74
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,308
the vocals!
