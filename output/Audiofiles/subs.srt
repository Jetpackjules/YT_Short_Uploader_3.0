to

unsubscribe.

10
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:05,080
Once they make

11
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,510
it hard to do

12
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,350
that I'm never

13
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:06,868
coming back

14
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:07,598

monthly basis

19
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:10,883
then most

20
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:11,357
likely I'm

21
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:12,001
coming back at

22
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,725

When I had to

36

move, they

37
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:21,659
