7
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:05,079
*I self isolate

8
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:05,242
pretty

9
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:06,393
aggressively.

10
00:00:06,393 --> 00:00:07,374
*lie in bed eat

11
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:07,993
a lot or

12
00:00:07,993 --> 00:00:08,939
nothing at all

13
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:10,054
cry editing to

14
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:10,648
clarify for

15
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:11,163
people in the

16
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:12,473
replies that I

17
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:13,143
do not stay in

18
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:14,193
bed and cry

19
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:15,213
all day and

20
00:00:15,213 --> 00:00:16,574
ruin my life.

21
00:00:16,574 --> 00:00:17,184
I mean these

22
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:17,884
are things I

23
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:18,644
do for a few

24
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,634
hours or maybe

25
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:20,124
half a day

26
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:20,444
when I'm

27
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:20,920
having a

28
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,494
particularly

29
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:22,144
bad time

30
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:23,254
mentally.

31
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:24,277
after that I'm

32
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:24,607
perfectly

33
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,325
capable of

34
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,174
getting up and

35
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:26,394
doing

36
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,051
something more

37
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,166
productive.

38
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:28,586
crying my

39
00:00:28,586 --> 00:00:29,257
emotions out

40
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:29,876
and resting

41
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:30,526
before going

42
00:00:30,526 --> 00:00:31,106
out and making

43
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:31,896
a plan and

44
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:32,446
working on

45
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:33,036
things makes

46
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:33,476
me feel

47
00:00:33,476 --> 00:00:34,404
better.
