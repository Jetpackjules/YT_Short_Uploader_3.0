You can learn any language instantly. Which language do you pick? 

*C++ 

*Spanish honestly comes most in handy where I've been 

*Sign Language would be pretty handy 

*Ancient archaic Sumerian 👍 One of the most important early civilisations, pre-dating Ancient Egypt.. the Sumerian language is mostly a mystery to us, as there are no similar languages found to cross-reference it with. So despite being one of the most important civilisations in history, almost all of their records and writings are unknown. So I would instantly learn Ancient Sumerian, thus becoming the single authority on Sumerian language. This would not only make me fabulously rich and famous, but would also bring huge amounts of knowledge and ancient history to light enriching the world 🙌
