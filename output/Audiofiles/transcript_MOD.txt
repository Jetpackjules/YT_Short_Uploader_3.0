What made you to think 

I'm never visiting again

 after being in someone's home? 

*When I was 17, my boyfriend at the time invited me to backyard camp at his friend's house. I knew the friend, he was super chill, so I said yes. Got there, some awesome tents were set up in the yard, grill was going, there was a giant cooler of drinks, I brought snacks. Everything was pretty awesome. His parents were so nice, his younger siblings came and played games with us, it was great. At one point I asked to go to the bathroom, so he showed me inside. It was so crawling with roaches, everything looked like it was moving. In my 5 minutes inside, I had to swat them off me every 30 seconds. His parents and siblings were just sitting around like nothing was wrong. My skin crawled for the rest of the night. Needless to say, I never went back.Which celebrity do you think has a lot of skeletons in their closet? 

*Sean Combs. I know he's in trouble for a thing, but I think it's just the tip of the iceberg. 

*Jimâ€“Bob Duggar 

*Anyone who was or is a scientologist. I read Leah ReminI's book. Holy cow. 

*Jared Leto. 

*Kris Jenner 

*Tom cruise ...it's wild to me this man pretty much has nothing to do with his daughter who seems like such a sweet girl. Going to Paris to root for Simone Biles but no where to be seen at SirI's graduation? Wow 

*Joel Osteen 

*Tom CruiseWhat often destroys relationships but is hardly talked about? 

*Silent resentment. Those unspoken grudges build up over time like dust bunnies under the bed, and one day they just explode all over the place!! 

*Lack of appreciation. When you stop noticing the little things your partner does, it can slowly erode the connection without anyone even realizing it!!! 

*Health. 

*Beating around the bush and making the other read between the lines. Just say it. 

*Lack of fun. I know relationships arent always easy. Work to do, baggage to deal with, real life issues, differing goals. But man, once the fun stops, what's the point of going through the motions? You can just do it solo as well at such point.
