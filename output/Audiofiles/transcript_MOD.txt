What is a company that will never get money from you again? 

*Any place that makes it hard to unsubscribe. Once they make it hard to do that I'm never coming back ever. You let me leave easy via web UI on a monthly basis then most likely I'm coming back at some point if entised or able. 

*Comcast. Been through enough customer service circles to last a lifetime. 

*Wells Fargo 

*Comcast. When I had to move, they made it next to impossible for me to cancel. Multiple hours on the phone. I'll never buy another product from them again. 

*Airbnb. 

Wait I paid for a cleaning service. Why is this idiot giving me a bad review for not cleaning?

 

*Ticketmaster
