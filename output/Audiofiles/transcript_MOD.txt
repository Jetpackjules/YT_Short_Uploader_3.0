How do you stop being 

The Nice Guy

 or get rid of the nice guy syndrome? 

*Be nice because you want to, not because you want a reward. 

*Stop looking at women as a transaction. You are specifically being nice and expecting things in return. If you are a nice person, be nice to everyone. Treat people you are interested in as human beings, treat them like you would a friend, and most importantly, respect their boundaries and if they reject you, move on. 

*To quote Sondheim, 

Nice is different than Good.

 The difference is that Nice guys are nice because they want something. Good guys are nice because that's the right way to treat people, whether or not they have something you want. Be a Good guy. Be kind and considerate, with no expectation of anything in return. Be authentic and open about who you are. If a woman isn't into you, that's a good thing because it means she wasn't a good fit for you anyway. When a woman is into you, it means she likes you for you, and not just because you were Nice.
