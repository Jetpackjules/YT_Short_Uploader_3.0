People who went to a wedding where the couple didn't last long, what happened? 

*Witnessed by my parents, not me During the wedding reception someone asked the bride and groom when they were going to have kids They had been dating for 8 years before getting married, so everyone assumed they were going to have kids immediately after getting married. The groom loudly said 

Oh man, I'm NEVER having kids!

 The Bride burst into tears and had to go to the restroom. They lasted about a year. You'd think that's something they would have talked about during that long time, but who knows. 

*The bride and groom got married and within 3 months, the bride found out the groom was married and had kids in a different country. 

*Both my brother and sister had short marriages. Sister: husband turned up to the wedding high on crack. She fell in love with someone else. Brother: had a destination wedding on the top of a mountain that took half a day for the guests to hike including my dad who is missing a knee cap. They wound up with an open marriage, but the wife ran off with the 

other guy

 and their cat.
