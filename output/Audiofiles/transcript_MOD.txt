If you could have the body type of an Olympian, which sport would you choose? 

*Male rowers are casually lumberjacks. I'd like to have a tree chopping physique. 

*Why wish, when I already have the physique of an Olympian? US men's curling team to be precise. 

*Rock climber. Then I would be good at rock climbing, something which I've tried and failed to be good at for more than a decade. 

*Pole vault, apparently they've got it where it counts. 

*Gymnastics. I think they all look so lean & toned with explosive muscles. 

*Rugby. Those women are built like tanks and I am here for it. 

*Swimmer 

*Beach Volleyball and it's not close. 

*Figure skater. ‚õ∏Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èü§çWhat massively improved your mental health? 

*Stay active. Staying active is as good for the brain as it is for the body. Regular exercise or activity can have a major impact on your mental and emotional health, relieve stress, improve memory, and help you sleep better. 

*Gardening! Ever since I started gardening landscaping included because I landscaped my backyard for the garden lol my mental health gradually increased and my outlook in life became more positive. Bonus for also growing my own food along the way. : 

*Stepping down my high horse. Understanding that I am only human and do not always have to be the best in everything. As a matter of fact, there is no 

being best

. Therefore, I learned to forgive myself and approve my emotions. That is what set me free.What was the most major cultural difference you noticed when you moved to another country? 

*Realizing that jaywalking in Vietnam is basically an extreme sport. 

*I know this is gonna sound dumb, but when I visited USA the first thing that I was in awe about, was the trees, because they looked different than the ones from Australia. I just kept looking at all the different trees and flowers, because they were not the same ones I would drive past for the majority of my life. 

*The most major cultural difference was discovering that in some countries, it's perfectly normal to eat dinner at 10 PM. My stomach was on a strict 

early dinner

 schedule and was not prepared for this late-night culinary adventureWhy not just leave a relationship instead of cheat? 

*A friend of mine once chose to cheat instead of leaving her relationship. She told me she was scared of being alone and felt guilty about hurting her partner, so she stayed and ended up making things worse. In the end, it caused more pain for everyone involved, and she regretted not being honest from the start. 

*some people want to have their cake and eat it 

*You can have 80% of your needs met in a relationship which is great and I think this is about the best most people can get from a partner, but then there will always be that 20% missing. People don't want to lose the 80%, but they're greedy enough to look for that 20% elsewhere.What's one thing that can instantly make you bond with a total stranger?

Where's a hot flash when you need one?

 Pretty funny since we both were 50+. We instantly formed a camaraderie of misery. 

*A good laugh over something unexpected, it's like a moment when you both find something funny at the same time. It breaks the ice and creates an instant connection, making it feel like you've known each other for much longer than a few minutes.What is the one thing you would never say
