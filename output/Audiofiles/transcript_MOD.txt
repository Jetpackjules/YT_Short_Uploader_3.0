What's a piece of advice you've received that initially seemed strange but turned out to be remarkably insightful? 

*This isn't exactly advice but my dad used to talk to me and send me stuff about all these cool technological breakthroughs. I can remember things like smart roads, and Crisper, and new solar panel efficiency. And we would talk about the new fusion breakthroughs and just cutting-edge stuff that I like to read about. So, my dad died about 6 months ago, suddenly and awful and me and my siblings were talking, and we realized he did the same thing to them, but more suited to their interests. My sister was all medical stuff, and my brother was all sports. We didn't realize until after he was gone that my dad used to research and read about his children's interests so he would have stuff to talk about with us. And it kinda wrecked me. My dad was always great, but we never realized just how great he was. So I guess the advice was, 

Get to know your kids. Share in their interests.

 

*This is not mine but something I read somewhere But essentially a girl was practicing archery and kept messing up and the instructor told her 

You're failing because you're too focused on the target and not your own actions

 She proceeded to say that it was the best life advice she had ever gotten.
