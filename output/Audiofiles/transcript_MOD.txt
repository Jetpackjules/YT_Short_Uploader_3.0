What massively improved your mental health? 

*Leaving a toxic work environment. 

*If only I'd realized this in my teens. People severely undererstimate what a tremendous impact sleep has on your day, productivity, mood...etc 

*Quit teaching high school. Got divorced. So much less stress I finally quit smoking. 

*I'm just here furiously taking notes 

*Learning to love myself. A few years ago, I was in a very low spot with my self esteem, and I wanted to be better. My therapist and I talked a lot about treating myself like I would a friend. It sounds cheesy, but I started writing compliments to myself on post it notes in the morning and placing them on a mirror. It didn't take too long before I started to believe them. It's amazing how being nice to yourself and giving yourself grace can really improve your mental health.
