What are you better at than 80% of people? 

*According to warcraft logs, enhancement shaman. 

*picking the slowest line at the store. If it is not slow before I get there, it will grind to a halt once I do... 

*Chess. I'm not good at chess, but 80%? Yeah that's a low bar. 

*Looking you directly in the face while your talking and not hearing a single thing 

*I have a very good internal clock. I know what time it is within 10 minutes and don't need an alarm clock to wake up. Even for like flights or whatever. If I know I need to be up at 3am, I'll wake up at like 2:30 or so. When I'm awake, I'm super awake, too. I don't really have grogginess. Edit: love seeing other people that have this. It's a pretty low-stakes 

superpower

. From the outside, other people never notice it. My wife is the opposite of me and is late to everything ever if I'm not involved. No one has ever been like 

Wow, you're just so punctual

 to me.
