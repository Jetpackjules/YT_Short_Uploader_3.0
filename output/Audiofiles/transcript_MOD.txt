What is one thing that you feel was 100% worth the money? 

*A quality and comfortable sofa or couch Good dental care and braces is well wroth it to me But for safety I would say quality tires is a must 

*Paying movers when moving into a new place. 

*A good pillow and a comfortable mattress 

*Impacted wisdom teeth out 

*For me it was lasik surgery. 

*My polarized prescription sunglasses. Pricey but so worth it, especially since I love to fish. Feels like I have xray vision when I look at the water.
