What's a civilization ending scenario that most people aren't aware of? 

*A slow-burn collapse is much more likely than a single major event to cause something major. 

*As a kid I learned that if a gamma ray burst is coming right at us we really can't do anything about it, we'd just get fried. Kept me up for a few nights. 

*Corn virus. 20% of Human Civilization's calories, right there. 

*A Gamma Ray Burst could fry our planet at any moment with 0 warning. Which means you should not waste time worrying about it because no one can do anything about it. 

*I rarely see the media being concerned about water. 

*Solar flare knocking out electric grids. Not only restarting them from a black start is highly complicated, if the transformers are fried, there aren't enough replacements, and to manufacture more we need, you guessed it, electricity. The estimations are that a solar flare on the level of Carrington event, which happened not two centuries ago, would cause trillions in damages and set back civilization for decades.
