Interracial couples of reddit, what was the biggest difference you had to get used to? 

*The dishwasher being used as a drying rack and not to actually wash dishes 

*I'm a white dude married to a black woman. I had no idea about the whole culture of hair upkeep for black women. How much it costs. How much time it takes. How much it's a connection point for her and other women. Interestingly, what was a bigger adjustment had nothing to do with race. I'm an only child and she is one of five so obviously the family dynamics are quite different. Next month we will be married for 24 years so I guess it's all good.
