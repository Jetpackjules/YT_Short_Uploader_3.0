People who liked Elon Musk but no longer do, what was the turning point? 

*when he fired his secretary who's been loyal to him for years after she asked for a raise 

*Quite honestly - the turning point was immediately after I started to like him. As I was starting to like him, even. The problem is that once you learn anything about him, you realize what a miserable sack of wasted flesh he is. Once you start looking into his social media presence, the reality becomes literally unavoidable. So I thought 

hey, that Musk guy with the solar panels seems like he might be onto something,

 and then one google search later I realized I had been wrong. This was quite a while ago, so his personal opinions weren't yet plastered everywhere.
