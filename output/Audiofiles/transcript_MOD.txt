What is actually healthy but people think is not? 

*Frozen fruits and vegetables. The modern flash-freeze technique preserves almost all of the nutrients and they are always picked when they are in season, so they are as nutritious as their fresh in-season counterparts, and more nutritious if it is not the season. 

*Sport during pregnancy. Actually a lot of things are healthy during pregnancy theres just too much misinformation. If your doctor explicitly says no sport then yes. Do that. But if doctor says ok then go ahead 

*Doing literally nothing to decompress. Sometimes one just needs to breathe and look out a window. 

*Crying. 

*Spending time alone.
