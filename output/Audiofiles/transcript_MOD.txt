What celebrity are you unable to like because of how fake they come off? 

*Tyra banks. Every time someone told a heart wrenching story about struggle or overcoming, she would make it about herself and how strong she is because she overcame your problem a long time ago. A classic one upper. 

oh yeah, same here, but mine was like way more difficult

 

*Simon Cowell. The guy knocked up his best friend's wife. Enough said. 

*James Corden 

*Any of the Kardashians or Jenners 

*Jojo Siwa. Nothing about her comes off as genuine. It all feels like such a persona that I'm immediately repulsed by anything she does. ESPECIALLY when she 

discovers

real

 her and it becomes her entire identity. I think she's judged two shows that I watch and none of her advice ever feels useable or applicable. 

You have a real energy about you and I want to see that come out in your feet. Let your dance smile like your face. And bring more of you into your dance because you have a real positive energy about you
