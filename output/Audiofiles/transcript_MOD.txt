What is the worst second hand embarrassment you've ever felt? 

*We were at an all-inclusive resort in Jamaica. Every night they had this common area where folks could do karaoke. A middle-aged gentleman got up and started the first few lines of Lionel Richie's 

Easy

. Some random lady from the audience ran up and attempted to sing the song with the gentleman. He kindly pushed her away two or three times as she tried to sing over his shoulder into the microphone. Finally, she just stood there dejected...swaying from side to side like an idiot - as the man broke from his song and professed his love for his girlfriend - and wrapped up with a marriage proposal. They hugged, they kissed...the idiot girl went back to her seat. I will still never understand why that guy chose THAT song to use to propose. However, he was killing the vocals!
