People who don't drink or smoke, what do you do when you are at your lowest? 

*I self isolate pretty aggressively. 

*lie in bed eat a lot or nothing at all cry editing to clarify for people in the replies that I do not stay in bed and cry all day and ruin my life. I mean these are things I do for a few hours or maybe half a day when I'm having a particularly bad time mentally. after that I'm perfectly capable of getting up and doing something more productive. crying my emotions out and resting before going out and making a plan and working on things makes me feel better.
