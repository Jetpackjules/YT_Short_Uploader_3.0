What's gotten so expensive that you no longer purchase it? 

*Food from food trucks. I'm not spending $15 for a grilled cheese that I have to wait in the rain for. 

*McDonald's. Wtf happened to the dollar menu?! There ain't nothing on there that costs a dollar. 

*Mobile apps. I'm absolutely infuriatingly tired of subscription services. The worst is that they let you download the app so they can claim it as a download, only to get stonewalled by a subscription page. Let's go back to a one time fee please. 

*At this rate, shelter and food. 

*Subway. Even the 6 inch subs are over $7 before chips and soda. 

*I never buy chips unless they're some kind of BOGO. 

*It's pretty damn expensive just to exist right now. 

*Frozen Pizzas are reaching the point of being more expensive than real pizza.
