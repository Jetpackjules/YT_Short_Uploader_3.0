What was the scariest moment you've had on vacation? 

*Lost my baby brother at seaside boardwalk. My family went crazy for about an hour. Finally found him sitting on the bar at outside saloon surrounded by bikers & their chicks. Bowl of popcorn and a tall soda. They were all facing the boardwalk & walking people go by waiting to see if he recognized anyone looking for him. 

*Went vacationing in Mexico with my family when I was 9. Lost my parents in a marketplace in Cancun and tried to tell a guy I was trying to find my family. He told me he'd find me a new one, moments before my father arrived. 

*Riding a travel bus along a narrow cliffside road in the Cordillera Central mountain range in the Philippines.
