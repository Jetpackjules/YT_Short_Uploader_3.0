What would be your reaction if Donald Trump dies tonight? 

*Well, my reaction would be that you should have a very strong alibi for tonight, just in case. 

*

holy shit, what did or u or kRe4ture know that the rest of us didn't?!

 

*

Aw, shit... I can smell the conspiracy engines firing up now!

 

*Wouldn't it be really weird if he actually drops dead tonight 

*

You should never say bad things about the dead, only good. Joan Crawford is dead... good!

 - Bette Davis 

*There's absolutely no way the conspiracy crowd would see it as just a normal thing that happens to old people. I'd be pretty worried tbh. 

*Thanks Obama! 

*I think it was Mark Twain that said while he'd never wish death on anyone, he's not been too upset at reading their obituary 

*Tonight - this weekend? Well, it will all depend on if he returns in 3 days.
