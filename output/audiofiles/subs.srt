1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:00,740
What's a dirty

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,649
little secret that

3
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:02,250
you know only

4
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,910
because you work

5
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,686
in the industry?

6
00:00:04,686 --> 00:00:06,208
*I own a sign shop,

7
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:07,059
and I can tell you

8
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:08,183
with 100%

9
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:08,750
certainly that

10
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,456
almost all

11
00:00:09,456 --> 00:00:10,339
businesses fail

12
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:10,980
within the first

13
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,034
year.

14
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:12,650
If you think you

15
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,410
are going to open

16
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,259
a restaurant or a

17
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,514
boutique,

18
00:00:15,514 --> 00:00:16,190
you are about to

19
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,899
lose a bunch of

20
00:00:16,899 --> 00:00:17,705
money.

21
00:00:17,705 --> 00:00:19,100
Also, no matter

22
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,670
what business you

23
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:20,762
want to start,

24
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:21,460
go talk to your

25
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,579
local sign guy and

26
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:23,230
ask how many

27
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,014
businesses have

28
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:24,510
been in that

29
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,233
location and

30
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,372
failed.

31
00:00:26,372 --> 00:00:27,760
Trust me, we know

32
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,530
which locations

33
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,157
are cursed.

34
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:31,154
*The grad students

35
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:31,674
teaching your

36
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:32,690
classes sometimes

37
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,600
have more direct

38
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,281
power over your

39
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:35,811
grade than your

40
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:36,813
professor.

41
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:37,640
Please be nice to

42
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,443
us.

43
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:39,289
Not even to get a

44
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,361
good grade,

45
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,020
just please be

46
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:41,990
nice to us because

47
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,740
we're stressed and

48
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,071
tired

49
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,659
*There isn't a

50
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:45,690
larger than normal

51
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,845
call volume.

52
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:47,570
We just don't have

53
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,756
enough staff.

54
00:00:48,756 --> 00:00:50,178
Also, your call is

55
00:00:50,178 --> 00:00:51,119
not important to

56
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:51,859
us.

57
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,659
We actually want

58
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,335
you to go away.
