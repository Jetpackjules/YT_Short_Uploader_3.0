What screams �I have depression�? completely tired all the time, even when you don�t do anythingConstantly in a world in your head. I struggle with living like this. My mind and body are normally never in the same place.Sleeping to avoid living. Even if you�re not necessarily tired.Intense irritation at small things.Feeling like it�s a chore to do things that you used to love doing.Snoozing for an eternity because you know what awaits you when you get up and face the day.I was driving, as I frequently do for work, and realized I didn't have Spotify or the radio on. I am a music nut. I had been driving that way for hours. Thought back and had multiple days like that.

Just wasn't interested in it. That was weirdly a big wake up call for me.

**EDIT:** This blew up way more than I thought it would, so I thought I would clarify since this is getting a lot of exposure.

Not listening to music is in NO way a sure-fire diagnosis for depression. Even in my most mentally-healthy phases, there is definitely times when I drive/cook/hang out in silence at times. That's normal.

What isn't normal is that I've been listening to music since I was really young, and really got into it when I was like 9-10. Music is probably my main hobby. In a job where I'm on the road for anywhere from 30 mins to 6 hours a day, I listen to music all the time when I'm not on the phone for work.

One day, I had been driving for several hours, and just felt... numb. I had a realization that no music was playing- this got me thinking about how long this had been going on, and I realized I had been driving like this for a few weeks now. I also love to cook and listen to music- I'll sing along, make up lyrics, sing to my son, and generally have fun. I had stopped doing this as well. I was already growing concerned about depression, so I discussed this with my psychologist/therapist and PCP. They both agreed, after several discussions, that I am clinically depressed and that not having interest in things you once loved is definitely a sign of depression. So it was one of the first real "wake-up" calls for me.
