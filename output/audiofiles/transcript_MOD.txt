What's a dirty little secret that you know only because you work in the industry? 

*I own a sign shop, and I can tell you with 100% certainly that almost all businesses fail within the first year. If you think you are going to open a restaurant or a boutique, you are about to lose a bunch of money. Also, no matter what business you want to start, go talk to your local sign guy and ask how many businesses have been in that location and failed. Trust me, we know which locations are cursed. 

*The grad students teaching your classes sometimes have more direct power over your grade than your professor. Please be nice to us. Not even to get a good grade, just please be nice to us because we're stressed and tired 

*There isn't a 

larger than normal call volume.

 We just don't have enough staff. Also, your call is not important to us. We actually want you to go away.
