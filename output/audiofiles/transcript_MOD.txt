To! those! who have! accidentally! killed someone,! what went! wrong?My. dad.! is. a! \n garbage! truck driver! in a! major city.! A few! years ago,! there was! a dead! and crushed! homeless man! found at! the dump.! They went! through the! camera footage! and the! tickets for! the trucks! coming and! going and! narrowed it! down to! my dad's! truck who! dumped the! man. The! guy was! sleeping in! a dumpster.! For those! of you! that don't! know, there's! a packer! blade in! the back! of those! trucks to! squish the! garbage to! make more! room.! He didn't! stand a! chance.No, but! I thought! I did! for almost! 2 years.! Very close! friend of! mine, the! kind of! guy that! always seemed! to be! happy and! everybody just! loved him.! Was hanging! out at! his place! (we were! 16 back! then) and! for whatever! reason I! don�t remember,! I showed! him how! to tie! the hangman�s! knot.! 3 days! later he! was dead.! His mom! called, claiming! he hung! himself and! it was! all my! fault. Fucked! me up! badly. My! friend was! dead, I! never saw! anything coming! and apparently! it was! even my! fault�! Almost 2! years later! we found! out by! coincidence, that! he killed! himself with! exhaust fumes! in his! mom�s car.! I�ll never! know, why! he did! it (which! still haunts! me sometimes)! or why! his mom! blamed me! with wrong! accusations (never! could be! angry about! that though,! given how! painful that! must have! been for! her) or! how she! knew about! that stupid! knot�!
