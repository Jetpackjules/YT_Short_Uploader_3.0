What is the safest answer when your girlfriend asks if her friend is hot?? 

*"ive never looked at her like that before" 

*Say...."No....but she's an awesome kisser!" 

*I literally start singing, "I only have eyes for you." I'm a terrible singer. After two versus, the conversation is over, and she has left the room. 

*"Yes, I would love you if you were a worm." 

*"Yea. Why? You interested in her?" 

*No hablo ingl√©s. 

*In an overly enthusiastic tone, "Why, did she ask about me?" Can't lose. 

*An ex pulled this on me regarding her best friend. My response, "She's alright, but her best friend is damn sexy." 

*not as hot as your mom.
