What's the craziest story you've heard of a couple breaking up? Newly married woman (a teacher at a local school) cheated on her husband (also a teacher at the same school) with the principal. They got caught in the act on school property. Both their careers ruined and probably ruined the husbands life. Well... my ex broke up with me at the beginning of a 10 hour flight. We lived together, and his mother picked us up from the airport..
