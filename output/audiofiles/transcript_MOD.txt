If you could dis-invent something, what would it be? Pop-up ads Household appliances that are tied to subscription services I have heard of three inventors who regret what they put into the world (not going to bother looking up names rn) The USB inventor regrets not making it so it could be inserted in either orientation The k-cup inventor regrets how much extra trash they cause The pop up inventor regrets inventing them at all. Landmines. Seriously. They fuck up people long after wars are finished The packages they put scissors inâ€¦ that you need scissor to open. Wtf? Spam calls, robo calls, phishing emails, pop up ads, and micro transactions in games planned obsolescence Those nearly-blinding, unnecessarily bright car head lamps. Gerrymandering The medical insurance industry. Subscription services. Either let me try it for free then buy it full Price or let me rent it and charge me only for the amount of time I used it for. EDIT: Of course, it doesn't apply to everything. Subscriptions make sense for something like Apple Music, Xbox Game Pass or Costco, but I don't want to have to pay Adobe 60 dollars a month for Photoshop when I could just rent a license. You don't subscribe to a car, you just rent it for how many days you need it for.
