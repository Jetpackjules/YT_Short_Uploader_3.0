[Response, substack: EQ Precursors, not so fast](https://earthquakeinsights.substack.com/p/earthquake-precursors-not-so-fast)\n\n*****\n\nEarthquake warning system up to 2 hours.\n\nPermanent GPS antennas are located all over the world and more densely at fault zones. About a year ago geologists found that if they stacked all historical GPS data proximal to large earthquakes, they saw there is a very small acceleration of the surface about two hours before the actual earthquake.\n\nWe are literally only missing the technology to make even more precise GPS measures, so we can do this in real time on singular regions. It is proven that this is an actual thing that happens and we can literally warn of earthquakes with a significant time span.\n\n> And the land movement is so subtle that only by lumping all the data together did the precursor stand out, Bletery says. \u201cIf you just remove one or two quakes, you still see it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you remove half, it\u2019s hard to see.\u201d\n\nThis is not a solution or has saved any lives, but it is an absolutely staggering discovery that will have an insane focus in the upcoming years.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/warning-signs-detected-hours-ahead-big-earthquakes",

The footprint is smaller,  and unlike nuclear power, you can turn it on and off pretty quickly which is important for filling the gaps in green energy when the sun doesn't shine or the wind stops blowing.  \n\nThe US government [just cleared out almost all the red tape](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/how-new-tech-is-making-geothermal-energy-a-more-versatile-power-source/) for digging geothermal wells on public land too, basically it is now as easy to dig a geothermal well as it is to dig an oil well.\n\n\n\nThey are even looking at using geothermal wells [like batteries](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/07/1069437/this-geothermal-startup-showed-its-wells-can-be-used-like-a-giant-underground-battery/) by pumping water into them and pressurizing them.

So worth it to spend $1.50 or whatever to use one rather than trying to use your own vacuum cleaner.  And, they get your car cleaner much faster than dragging out your home vacuum to try to clean your car with. \n\n2. Electronics.  Buy them new from brand name shops.  It isn't worth hassling to save $10 somewhere and getting something that doesn't work or doesn't have a reasonable return policy. \n\n3. Household help.  If you can afford it get someone to come in and clean your house on a regular basis.  So it stays...always clean, without you having to do anything. \n\n4. Education.  Now this is a big one and far more could be written about it.  Obviously not all education expense is worthwhile, so I'm not necessarily referring to a college degree or whatnot.  But educating yourself - or especially, educating kids if you have them, can return dividends throughout their life. \n\n  \n'",

And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money.

On the occasion that she and her husband join friends for a cruise or resort stay, her main concern is cost (which ruins a huge part of the trip for her every time) and monitoring how others are \u201cwasting\u201d their money (never to their faces - this is just what she says to me after). \n\nHer husband used to be a pretty fun guy about 30 years ago, when they met, but has become bitter and grumpy after decades of having to fight for things she deems \u201cunnecessary\u201d, like tickets to his favorite concerts or pricey sports/music memorabilia (which he\u2019s always been into). It has resulted in dishonesty between the two (which is not the kind of guy he really is) and she has grown disgusted by his need for \u201cchildish\u201d hobbies and entertainment. My sister has always been a bit of a fun-hater, but it\u2019s gotten to the point where it makes her, and sometimes the people around her, miserable. \n\nShe lives and works in a small town and pays attention to who is getting free lunch, who is paying with food stamps at checkout, who is driving a car they can\u2019t afford, etc. She has called me and listed the items she\u2019s seen a family buying with food stamps - can\u2019t fathom them buying Doritos and Kool-Aid. \n\nThere is more than one way to be bad with money.",

I also don't want to install an app just to do something that works just fine on a website.\n\nAlso requiring Internet connectivity is crappy design.  I don't want basic functionality depending on your servers being up (and requiring accounts and giving you unknown data).  My whatever should not stop working because you decided to stop spending money on the servers.  This is bad with software but egregious with hardware and unacceptable with household devices (my water heater should never depend on outside servers).\n\nI've been in tech a long time.  While greed and control and access to sellable data drives lots of things, there is also an attitude surviving from the 90s and 00s that the lifespan of anything is a few years.  This attitude infects product design even in fields where lifespans are decades and replacement costs are high as we add compute to everything (which can be a great thing).\n\nUSB was successful not because it had one (ish) plug, but because it standardized the protocols devices used.  All mice speak one protocol, so anything that knows it (hci class) can handle any mouse.

He was disabled for the first two years of his life, until an inventor called Gene Flemings heard about his disability and decided to create a new method of movement for him - he initially tried to teach Andy to ride a skateboard, but eventually settled on teaching the goose to walk in baby-sized sneakers. Since Gene worked with a local charity for disabled children, Andy became a role model - and even caught the eyes of the media, with Nike offering a lifetime supply of shoes, and the pair featuring on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\n\nAndy disappeared on October 19th, 1991, and was later found with his head and wings torn off.

It was the third time the courts had been involved with her due to \u201cdrug abuse\u201d. But her drug of choice was huffing. The only huffing case I ever had. She was absolutely a lovely person. She had worked hard to earn a degree and enter into a career field. She was kind and beautiful. She was cooperative and she was determined. But despite how hard she was trying she would relapse and this was to be the last chance she got with the courts so the stakes were high. We worked so well together. She spent 18 months going to treatment, getting re-employed, getting her own place and having increased visits with her kids. Who were also wonderful. The kids had been staying at her parent\u2019s place while we were working towards progress. We went to court and requested reunification and the judge granted it. We were all so proud of her!! And happy for them as a family. We planned to fully move her kids home with her a week from that very court date. \n\nTwo days before we planned to return her kids to her she drove her car through the front of a Walmart because she had been huffing and was high. She killed a Walmart employee and proceeded to huff herself to death in the electronics isle, where there was keyboard duster spray, while law enforcement was on its way. I got the news at 5am that she was dead and had to go tell her children they wouldn\u2019t be going back to their mother. Ever.",

Ed was always complaining about something,  every single day there was some new issue, some problem. He was a bit of a pain. He got into an argument with one of our supervisors over the radio one day and earned himself a 3 day suspension.\n\nHis first morning back from his suspension. First route of the day, he gets on the radio and starts back complaining. Dispatch asks him a few simple questions, he responds with hostility and some really unprofessional comments. The director of transportation (our big boss) gets on the radio and asks Ed to meet him in his office after morning routes. Ed responds, \"I'll be there if I have time\" boss says, \"I need you to understand, this is not optional\" Ed comes back, \"I need YOU to understand, I'll be there if I have time!\" Mind you, this is on the radio as we are picking up high school kids, everyone can hear what's happening this entire time. Another dispatcher calls in and tells Ed \"when you finish your high school route, park your bus there at the school. We are bringing someone to take your route over, and to bring you back to the lot\". Ed did not like this and responded by saying, \"Negative. I am finishing my route. Me. If you want someone to drive my route, you get (our boss's boss) and have her come drive this route. Otherwise, I am finishing my route.\"  Dispatch asked for an ETA to the high school, he responded \"whenever (our boss's boss) is gonna be there. Otherwise, I get there when I get there\". Somewhere around this time he starts talking like, they were targeting him and picking on him and that  \"it ends today\". Again, at this point he has a bus full of high school kids.\n\nNow, I did not see what happened at the high school, but I heard from several other drivers. Apparently the police were waiting for him once he got there and they removed him from his bus. To quote one driver \"he acted a fool the entire time\". I'm not sure exactly what he was charged with, maybe kidnapping since he acted like he wasn't gonna bring the kids to school unless he got what he wanted? Theft for not bringing the bus back? No clue. But I do know he was arrested and fired. A few days later we get the news that he had a heart attack and died. Most likely from all the stress.",

He installed hidden cameras throughout his house because he convinced himself that his wife was probably cheating too.

My parents caught him red-handed all over a woman at a concert that he didn't think they would be at. They told his wife and she called him and he lied and then let slip that he knew where she was. That's when she found the cameras and the air tag on her car. \n\nNow, none of his children talk to him, he lost the house, his friends, his music buddies, everything. The woman too. She left him when he had nothing to give. And he's not remotely apologetic about it and still tries to convince people that he was in the right.

Looking at what the democrats under Biden have been able to do with the CHIPs act, the IRA, the infrastructure bill, erasing student debt, winning back state legislatures, coordinate aid for Ukraine, nudge the Saudis and Israelis closer, working the Hungarians and Turks behind the scenes to allow the Swedes and Finns into NATO, putting China on the economic defensive, etc. I can only dream of what Obama could have achieved if he had more experience in govt. \n\nIn summary: still love Obama the person but I wish he had more experience going into the presidency and could work the US govt to get more of his goals achieved.",

They were all late teens/early 20s with multiple kids each already.\n\nBut during the depression, Kraft Cheese started sending super cheap fake cheese and other dairy products into the area, undercutting all the local dairies.\n\nMy grandpa and his brothers realized that they still depended on the local dairy industry as customers, so they robbed the trains of all the Kraft cheese and threw it into fields to rot.\n\n The local law just couldn\u2019t seem to catch the bandits that were trying to save the town economy. A reporter from Chicago was on one of the trains and got a picture of their faces, and they all went to \u201ccollege\u201d for a few years.\n\nWhen I graduated college, my grandmother said I was the first in the family. I asked what about great grandpa, and she said \u201cOh no, he went to prison, not college.\u201d But no one else in the family ever knew either, lol.\n\nWhen they got out, they were all voted in as town councilmen, literally had customers for life.   My great-grandmother ran the store while they were in prison, and she went on to run it until she retired at 93 years old.  Great grandpa had died in his 60s.\n\nEdit to add:  mom says the \u201creporter\u201d from Chicago probably worked for Kraft because that\u2019s where the parent company was from.  And only one brother actually got his face caught on camera, but the other two confessed to get him a lighter sentence - and my great grandmother was adamant that my great great uncle did not roll over on his brothers, the other brothers decided to broker a deal for a reduced sentence.\n\n2nd edit:  it was my great-grandfather and his two brother-in-laws, not brothers.  They went to \u201ccollege\u201d in Texas. This happened in Louisiana.  And they did it to support a general strike by the dairy farmers, not just because of prices.  They starting shipping in Kraft cheese and milk to break the strike, so they robbed the train of Kraft cheese and milk.  Problem solved.\n\n3rd edit just to add a little flavor:  one of the Brothers (my great grandma was the second to last of 14!) who went to \u201ccollege\u201d asked his nephew to look after his wife while he was gone, and the nephew sure did!  He got his aunt (by marriage) pregnant while my great great uncle was in Texas.\n\nSo while I appreciate the calls for a movie, there may be some details like this that the family does not want brought into the light, lol.",

Could be illness, could be parental separation, could be abuse. Etc etc etc\n\n\n\n\n(Longer explanation: teeth grow at a predictable rate. Almost exactly like trees. If you bisected a tooth, and examined it under a microscope, you'd see rings of growth. Growth is disrupted in times of stress. The first stress \"ring\" we all had on our baby teeth is from birth. Other stressors can create other disrupted growth rings in baby teeth. And the same is true for adult teeth as they are still forming.\n\n\nMy former professor was a pioneer in dental anthropology. For his work on these stress lines, he'd ask his zoo colleagues to send him the teeth of deceased primates, or just teeth that had to be pulled. Would demand no other information be given at first. Then he, and his grad students would section the teeth. Put them under a microscope, and print out the pictures. They'd mark visible signs of disrupted growth. And, with knowing that birth is the first disruption, and the rate at which teeth grow... they could then give day counts for every growth disruption after birth.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce they collected their data, my professor would then ask their zoo colleagues for the daily health logs for the primate.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd what they found is that each growth disruption exactly corresponed to stress events in the primates life. Some instances were from illness or the like.\u00a0 But, to me, the most interesting event he told us about was seeing a stress line on the tooth that exactly corresponded with the primate, as a baby, being removed from their mother for a period of time to do necessary health checks at the zoo. This caused such a stress response in the baby that it was visible in the tooth growth)\u00a0",
