[Response, substack: EQ Precursors, not so fast](https://earthquakeinsights.substack.com/p/earthquake-precursors-not-so-fast)\n\n*****\n\nEarthquake warning system up to 2 hours.\n\nPermanent GPS antennas are located all over the world and more densely at fault zones. About a year ago geologists found that if they stacked all historical GPS data proximal to large earthquakes, they saw there is a very small acceleration of the surface about two hours before the actual earthquake.\n\nWe are literally only missing the technology to make even more precise GPS measures, so we can do this in real time on singular regions. It is proven that this is an actual thing that happens and we can literally warn of earthquakes with a significant time span.\n\n> And the land movement is so subtle that only by lumping all the data together did the precursor stand out, Bletery says. \u201cIf you just remove one or two quakes, you still see it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you remove half, it\u2019s hard to see.\u201d\n\nThis is not a solution or has saved any lives, but it is an absolutely staggering discovery that will have an insane focus in the upcoming years.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/warning-signs-detected-hours-ahead-big-earthquakes",

The footprint is smaller,  and unlike nuclear power, you can turn it on and off pretty quickly which is important for filling the gaps in green energy when the sun doesn't shine or the wind stops blowing.  \n\nThe US government [just cleared out almost all the red tape](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/how-new-tech-is-making-geothermal-energy-a-more-versatile-power-source/) for digging geothermal wells on public land too, basically it is now as easy to dig a geothermal well as it is to dig an oil well.\n\n\n\nThey are even looking at using geothermal wells [like batteries](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/07/1069437/this-geothermal-startup-showed-its-wells-can-be-used-like-a-giant-underground-battery/) by pumping water into them and pressurizing them.

So worth it to spend $1.50 or whatever to use one rather than trying to use your own vacuum cleaner.  And, they get your car cleaner much faster than dragging out your home vacuum to try to clean your car with. \n\n2. Electronics.  Buy them new from brand name shops.  It isn't worth hassling to save $10 somewhere and getting something that doesn't work or doesn't have a reasonable return policy. \n\n3. Household help.  If you can afford it get someone to come in and clean your house on a regular basis.  So it stays...always clean, without you having to do anything. \n\n4. Education.  Now this is a big one and far more could be written about it.  Obviously not all education expense is worthwhile, so I'm not necessarily referring to a college degree or whatnot.  But educating yourself - or especially, educating kids if you have them, can return dividends throughout their life. \n\n  \n'",

And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money.

On the occasion that she and her husband join friends for a cruise or resort stay, her main concern is cost (which ruins a huge part of the trip for her every time) and monitoring how others are \u201cwasting\u201d their money (never to their faces - this is just what she says to me after). \n\nHer husband used to be a pretty fun guy about 30 years ago, when they met, but has become bitter and grumpy after decades of having to fight for things she deems \u201cunnecessary\u201d, like tickets to his favorite concerts or pricey sports/music memorabilia (which he\u2019s always been into). It has resulted in dishonesty between the two (which is not the kind of guy he really is) and she has grown disgusted by his need for \u201cchildish\u201d hobbies and entertainment. My sister has always been a bit of a fun-hater, but it\u2019s gotten to the point where it makes her, and sometimes the people around her, miserable. \n\nShe lives and works in a small town and pays attention to who is getting free lunch, who is paying with food stamps at checkout, who is driving a car they can\u2019t afford, etc. She has called me and listed the items she\u2019s seen a family buying with food stamps - can\u2019t fathom them buying Doritos and Kool-Aid. \n\nThere is more than one way to be bad with money.",

I also don't want to install an app just to do something that works just fine on a website.\n\nAlso requiring Internet connectivity is crappy design.  I don't want basic functionality depending on your servers being up (and requiring accounts and giving you unknown data).  My whatever should not stop working because you decided to stop spending money on the servers.  This is bad with software but egregious with hardware and unacceptable with household devices (my water heater should never depend on outside servers).\n\nI've been in tech a long time.  While greed and control and access to sellable data drives lots of things, there is also an attitude surviving from the 90s and 00s that the lifespan of anything is a few years.  This attitude infects product design even in fields where lifespans are decades and replacement costs are high as we add compute to everything (which can be a great thing).\n\nUSB was successful not because it had one (ish) plug, but because it standardized the protocols devices used.  All mice speak one protocol, so anything that knows it (hci class) can handle any mouse.

He was disabled for the first two years of his life, until an inventor called Gene Flemings heard about his disability and decided to create a new method of movement for him - he initially tried to teach Andy to ride a skateboard, but eventually settled on teaching the goose to walk in baby-sized sneakers. Since Gene worked with a local charity for disabled children, Andy became a role model - and even caught the eyes of the media, with Nike offering a lifetime supply of shoes, and the pair featuring on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\n\nAndy disappeared on October 19th, 1991, and was later found with his head and wings torn off.

It was the third time the courts had been involved with her due to \u201cdrug abuse\u201d. But her drug of choice was huffing. The only huffing case I ever had. She was absolutely a lovely person. She had worked hard to earn a degree and enter into a career field. She was kind and beautiful. She was cooperative and she was determined. But despite how hard she was trying she would relapse and this was to be the last chance she got with the courts so the stakes were high. We worked so well together. She spent 18 months going to treatment, getting re-employed, getting her own place and having increased visits with her kids. Who were also wonderful. The kids had been staying at her parent\u2019s place while we were working towards progress. We went to court and requested reunification and the judge granted it. We were all so proud of her!! And happy for them as a family. We planned to fully move her kids home with her a week from that very court date. \n\nTwo days before we planned to return her kids to her she drove her car through the front of a Walmart because she had been huffing and was high. She killed a Walmart employee and proceeded to huff herself to death in the electronics isle, where there was keyboard duster spray, while law enforcement was on its way. I got the news at 5am that she was dead and had to go tell her children they wouldn\u2019t be going back to their mother. Ever.",

Ed was always complaining about something,  every single day there was some new issue, some problem. He was a bit of a pain. He got into an argument with one of our supervisors over the radio one day and earned himself a 3 day suspension.\n\nHis first morning back from his suspension. First route of the day, he gets on the radio and starts back complaining. Dispatch asks him a few simple questions, he responds with hostility and some really unprofessional comments. The director of transportation (our big boss) gets on the radio and asks Ed to meet him in his office after morning routes. Ed responds, \"I'll be there if I have time\" boss says, \"I need you to understand, this is not optional\" Ed comes back, \"I need YOU to understand, I'll be there if I have time!\" Mind you, this is on the radio as we are picking up high school kids, everyone can hear what's happening this entire time. Another dispatcher calls in and tells Ed \"when you finish your high school route, park your bus there at the school. We are bringing someone to take your route over, and to bring you back to the lot\". Ed did not like this and responded by saying, \"Negative. I am finishing my route. Me. If you want someone to drive my route, you get (our boss's boss) and have her come drive this route. Otherwise, I am finishing my route.\"  Dispatch asked for an ETA to the high school, he responded \"whenever (our boss's boss) is gonna be there. Otherwise, I get there when I get there\". Somewhere around this time he starts talking like, they were targeting him and picking on him and that  \"it ends today\". Again, at this point he has a bus full of high school kids.\n\nNow, I did not see what happened at the high school, but I heard from several other drivers. Apparently the police were waiting for him once he got there and they removed him from his bus. To quote one driver \"he acted a fool the entire time\". I'm not sure exactly what he was charged with, maybe kidnapping since he acted like he wasn't gonna bring the kids to school unless he got what he wanted? Theft for not bringing the bus back? No clue. But I do know he was arrested and fired. A few days later we get the news that he had a heart attack and died. Most likely from all the stress.",

He installed hidden cameras throughout his house because he convinced himself that his wife was probably cheating too.

My parents caught him red-handed all over a woman at a concert that he didn't think they would be at. They told his wife and she called him and he lied and then let slip that he knew where she was. That's when she found the cameras and the air tag on her car. \n\nNow, none of his children talk to him, he lost the house, his friends, his music buddies, everything. The woman too. She left him when he had nothing to give. And he's not remotely apologetic about it and still tries to convince people that he was in the right.

Looking at what the democrats under Biden have been able to do with the CHIPs act, the IRA, the infrastructure bill, erasing student debt, winning back state legislatures, coordinate aid for Ukraine, nudge the Saudis and Israelis closer, working the Hungarians and Turks behind the scenes to allow the Swedes and Finns into NATO, putting China on the economic defensive, etc. I can only dream of what Obama could have achieved if he had more experience in govt. \n\nIn summary: still love Obama the person but I wish he had more experience going into the presidency and could work the US govt to get more of his goals achieved.",

They were all late teens/early 20s with multiple kids each already.\n\nBut during the depression, Kraft Cheese started sending super cheap fake cheese and other dairy products into the area, undercutting all the local dairies.\n\nMy grandpa and his brothers realized that they still depended on the local dairy industry as customers, so they robbed the trains of all the Kraft cheese and threw it into fields to rot.\n\n The local law just couldn\u2019t seem to catch the bandits that were trying to save the town economy. A reporter from Chicago was on one of the trains and got a picture of their faces, and they all went to \u201ccollege\u201d for a few years.\n\nWhen I graduated college, my grandmother said I was the first in the family. I asked what about great grandpa, and she said \u201cOh no, he went to prison, not college.\u201d But no one else in the family ever knew either, lol.\n\nWhen they got out, they were all voted in as town councilmen, literally had customers for life.   My great-grandmother ran the store while they were in prison, and she went on to run it until she retired at 93 years old.  Great grandpa had died in his 60s.\n\nEdit to add:  mom says the \u201creporter\u201d from Chicago probably worked for Kraft because that\u2019s where the parent company was from.  And only one brother actually got his face caught on camera, but the other two confessed to get him a lighter sentence - and my great grandmother was adamant that my great great uncle did not roll over on his brothers, the other brothers decided to broker a deal for a reduced sentence.\n\n2nd edit:  it was my great-grandfather and his two brother-in-laws, not brothers.  They went to \u201ccollege\u201d in Texas. This happened in Louisiana.  And they did it to support a general strike by the dairy farmers, not just because of prices.  They starting shipping in Kraft cheese and milk to break the strike, so they robbed the train of Kraft cheese and milk.  Problem solved.\n\n3rd edit just to add a little flavor:  one of the Brothers (my great grandma was the second to last of 14!) who went to \u201ccollege\u201d asked his nephew to look after his wife while he was gone, and the nephew sure did!  He got his aunt (by marriage) pregnant while my great great uncle was in Texas.\n\nSo while I appreciate the calls for a movie, there may be some details like this that the family does not want brought into the light, lol.",

Could be illness, could be parental separation, could be abuse. Etc etc etc\n\n\n\n\n(Longer explanation: teeth grow at a predictable rate. Almost exactly like trees. If you bisected a tooth, and examined it under a microscope, you'd see rings of growth. Growth is disrupted in times of stress. The first stress \"ring\" we all had on our baby teeth is from birth. Other stressors can create other disrupted growth rings in baby teeth. And the same is true for adult teeth as they are still forming.\n\n\nMy former professor was a pioneer in dental anthropology. For his work on these stress lines, he'd ask his zoo colleagues to send him the teeth of deceased primates, or just teeth that had to be pulled. Would demand no other information be given at first. Then he, and his grad students would section the teeth. Put them under a microscope, and print out the pictures. They'd mark visible signs of disrupted growth. And, with knowing that birth is the first disruption, and the rate at which teeth grow... they could then give day counts for every growth disruption after birth.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce they collected their data, my professor would then ask their zoo colleagues for the daily health logs for the primate.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd what they found is that each growth disruption exactly corresponed to stress events in the primates life. Some instances were from illness or the like.\u00a0 But, to me, the most interesting event he told us about was seeing a stress line on the tooth that exactly corresponded with the primate, as a baby, being removed from their mother for a period of time to do necessary health checks at the zoo. This caused such a stress response in the baby that it was visible in the tooth growth)\u00a0",

She was funny, smart and a real joy to teach. Her period started that year and, instead of embarrassment at the mess, she was so happy because \u201cmy mama said now I can have babies\u201d. She got pregnant in 4th grade, had her first child in 5th grade and before high school, had a total of 4 children when she dropped out. Broke my heart. (My co-worker called one day to tell me she caught her in a park with a military guy who freaked when told she was in elementary school.)",

She says between gasping for air that she has asthma. I ask if she wants to go back to the shallow end. Exhausted and out of breath she just nods her head yes.

My girlfriend is persian.\n\nIn the netherlands, or at least in my experience, when people say no to something, then they mean no. While apparently for persians it's seen as polite to decline at least the first offer, often also the second even if you actually really want.\n\nSo for example, If she would offer me a cookie and i'd say no, She would ask another 3 times before letting it go, which was cute but also annoying. Meanwhile when i offer her a cookie and she says no. I just quit asking and then she gets a little mad that i didn't ask her a couple of times more.\n\nIt's not like the biggest difference or anything but it's a cute, and in the beginning, a very confusing difference\n\nEdit: wow, did not expect 14k upvotes for this comment and i really love to learn so much about these kind of customs and that they are more widespread than i thought it would be! Especially in europe i did not expect it was common in ireland, finland and austria. Thanks for all the upvotes and interesting tidbits of culture that you've shared with me.\n\nAlso for those wondering. I know my girlfriend by now and the other way around. So yes, sometimes the tarof happens and im prepared for that, and meanwhile my girlfriend knows im not that familiar with tarof so there's never mich confusion between us. We value good communication \n\nHave a great day you guys",

Just yesterday I learned that in California, there's a mascot called Smokey Bear that taught kids about forest fires. In turn, I told her about Singa the Courtesy Lion, which is a mascot to teach people courtesy/good manners.

At first i thought maybe he's just really focused or motivated at the time. He doesn't express anger at all but at the same time he doesn't express ANYTHING at all. That's when i know something is up with him. Coming from a half Latino household, we are very loud and expressive especially when we are stressed out, worried, or angry. The Asian and Latino cultures are so opposite in so many ways but yet so alike it's quite a journey being married to an Asian man. I wouldn't have it any other way tbh.

I was checking the voicemail at the dialysis clinic when I opened one morning because sometimes our patients will leave us a message the night before if they know they're going to be late or miss treatment. Sweet elderly patient had left a message that said \"I'm sorry ladies, I won't make it tomorrow morning. I'm going to see Hazel.\" Hazel was his wife who passed away 4 years earlier. I immediately called house- no answer. Called his son that was listed as an emergency contact and he tells me he was just about to call us to let us know his father passed away in the night. \n\nHis dad had gotten all of his paperwork with his will out of his safe, watered the house plants, put money for each of his utility payments in labeled envelopes,  put on his best suit, shined his dress shoes, left a message for us at the clinic, left a message for his choir director letting him know he wouldn't need a ride to practice in two days, then he sat down in his recliner and died. (As far as I know and according to his family he didn't do or take anything to expedite his exit, he just went to sleep in that recliner)",

You don't have to fill silence with conversation, though if silence makes you uncomfortable, you might feel more at ease turning on some background noise like music or a podcast or something if you can.\n\nBeing quiet doesn't mean you're weird or that the situation is awkward by default. Lags in conversation can be the result of, and useful for, processing the other person's perspective, suggestions, and logic. It also frees up a little mental space for considering the best way to respond to someone, especially if you feel a need to be particularly respectful or gentle.\n\nSpeaking for myself, quiet is the best part of a relationship. If I'm not talking to my partner, I'm just enjoying having them near me. I'm looking at their eyes or body language, feeling them breathe, listening to their heartbeat, or just being content in their presence. That person is enough for me, I don't feel the need to prevent silence.",

It's pretty good, but there is an unhealthy cult following for this dip from all the locals that live in this middle class area. If someone is having a little party or get together with some wine you know there's going to be some better cheddar on the table.\n\nAnyways, one 4th of July weekend we didn't have any more better cheddar. We were completely out and we're waiting for our supplier to drop off this very specific type of cheddar we used to make it and most people understood if you come back tomorrow... the 4th, we'll have plenty in stock and your party will be saved. Except 1 woman. \n\nWhen she learned we didn't have any in stock you would swear we just told her the only cure to her life ending disease was just flushed down the toilet because we didn't think anyone had the disease. She went to the fridge with all our other dips and what not in it and started opening the dips and throwing them around the cafe/store area making a HUGE mess. People were covered in spinach artichoke, buffalo chicken, bleu cheese dip, all the dips were wasted and when the display fridge was emptied she slammed the door causing the glass to crack all the way from the bottom to the top. Some of the containers she threw broke the TV, they broke the display cases for our fancy cheeses and prepared foods you just need to heat up. An estimate of the waste and damage would be around $3000 because those display cases were old and finding a replacement glass was impossible because it was curved, so a new one would need to be specially made somewhere in upstate new york.\n\nBest part of it all was she was a friend of the owner. We all knew her very well because she would come in 3, 4, 5 times a week order off the menu and just be a problem. When she came in a few days later I was the one who decided we're not dealing with her BS anymore and refused service. She got defensive left and came back with the owner. Like a child tattling on someone. I had the pleasure of telling the owner she was the cause of all the damage and the reason we were closed on the 4th to fix the damage. The owner was not aware of this, I assume the manager just told them a random customer got angry. Lady tried to deny it but the head chef and me had pulled a copy of the security video immediately, so we could watch it again and laugh, and showed the owner.\n\nOwner insisted the woman would need to pay for the damages and lost product other wise there would be legal action and she would not be allowed back in until she does... 3 months later, glass still broken, I was written up for not serving her. I quit shortly after that and after I found a better job bar tending in the city. This was about 11-12 years ago now and I recently went in to pick up some better cheddar for a work thing, the glass on the dip fridge is still broken in the exact same way and some of the dips that hit the roof are still there.",

Straight up disappeared and nobody knew where he went. \n\nI was on a two week school trip back then myself, so I was more disconnected of the whole thing, but apparently his parents had divorced (only one person got the info very late) and he wanted a short break to gather his thoughts. He even had made plans with our other friends to meet after said time. Only to just\u2026 not to do so.\nHe stopped answering to everyone, abandoned every account he had and\u2026 just stopped being.\n\nThe friend, who got the memo, and I had suspected for a while that he might be depressed, due to his slowly growing drinking habit in the evening and subtle change in personality. We even voiced our concerns back then, which he, according to his own words, appreciated.\n\nThose of us who could would try to visit him often and look for him at home, only for his new roommate to just turn them away with \u201che isn\u2019t home at the moment.\u201d Don\u2019t know if he delivered the memos or gifts we left either. \n\nI understand if he didn\u2019t want to be friends with us anymore. Anyone has the right to that and doesn\u2019t have to justify it, but since the change came so sudden and concerned everyone, especially since he wasn\u2019t doing well, everyone was really worried.\n\nA few months later one of our other friends met him surprisingly at a work event, where he tried to talk with him. He was miserable and not looking good, but alive, which to some extent calmed some of us a bit. According to our friend he was indeed depressed and was trapped in the non stop downwards spiral, where he couldn\u2019t answer his friends but wanted to, feeling more and more ashamed of himself and so withdrawing even more. My friend tried to calm him and had apparently a good talk. They even made plans to meet again, only for my friend to cancel them due to an own private emergency. After that our missing friend didn\u2019t respond again.\n\nShortly after that there was a huge fight with some\nother friends of the group (unrelated, but the stress from said incident didn\u2019t help), which split it definitely. It was pure chaos and a stressful time. I mean we still talk separately together, do stuff now and then, even got new friends into the group, but it\u2019s not the same anymore\u2026 \nAlso it might seem rather silly, but I still write to my missing friend from time to time \u2013 don\u2019t know if he gets them though. As long as he doesn\u2019t tell me to quit it, I will continue to do so. I miss him dearly. \n\nSorry for the long rant. It has been two years, but I just realised how much this has affected me.\nI just hope he\u2019s doing better, everything else is not important.",

Around the same time, four of our friends started having landlord troubles. We found out there were empty apartments at our complex, so we told them to check the place out. They liked it and decided to sign a lease.\n\nLess than 24 hours after they moved in, they were victims of an armed home invasion. Two were shot, thankfully non-fatally, but both of them are disabled for life. \n\nWhile the two that were shot were in the hospital, the other two moved in with us. They were, to say the least, bad guests. We were finding soda cans and candy wrappers stuffed in sofas and hidden behind furniture for months afterwards.\n\nWhen they moved back to their apartment, they took advantage of the apartment managers' pity and scammed months of free rent out of them before they said \"Enough is enough,\" and told them to leave.\n\nThey had completely trashed the apartment. On top of it, they told the company coming after them for the rent that the two injured guys were still on the lease (they were not)and should go after them too. The other guys had to spend their recuperation time trying to prove they weren't liable for that rent. \n\nOf the two that weren't injured, one went back to their home state, the other moved back home and cut contact with everyone. \n\nOne good thing came out of it. The two guys who were shot started hanging out more often with each other. One guy's sister made friends with the other guy. Then they started dating. They've now been together for over 10 years and have two kids.",

At first I wrote it off to his being an outdoorsy kid. I mentioned it to his doctor, he just laughed and said he's a rough and tumble little boy. Okay fine. Then winter came, and his bruises were just as bad as they were in the summer, if not worse. Again I asked his doctor who again said he's just a regular boy, he probably bruises himself while playing with his friends. He was given blood tests, blood cell count was normal and nothing unusual was found. It really bothered me, I just knew something was wrong - his bruises were huge and he was starting to have frequent nose bleeds. My husband also had frequent nosebleeds, he was used to them, had them his whole life, and considered them normal so he was not at all worried about our son. But I was! I started to do my own research, (without aging myself too much, this was before Google, so I made numerous trips to the library and browsed through many medical books).  I found out about a rare disorder called Von Willebrand Disease- VWD is an inherited blood clotting disorder. My son had all the symptoms, and I realized, hey, so did my husband! A few years before, my husband had his wisdom teeth removed and the bleeding was non-stop, he kept blaming it on \"horrible stitches and a sloppy dentist\", instead no, the dentist was fine, it was VWD. So I went back to my son's doctor and told him to test him for VWD. The doctor opened his eyes in shock, and realized I was onto something. My husband, son, daughter and I were all tested. It's a specific blood test, that measures platelets, factor 8 (a blood clotting agent) and timing of clotting. It is not a routine blood test, that's why it was never found in either my husband or my son. So - it turns out my son and my husband have a mild form of VWD. My daughter does not - so it is not 100% passed on if one parent has it. VWD is not dangerous and does not affect their day to day lives, but it is so important to know if one has it! Before any type of surgery -  they will need a special a special medication given before hand to aid in the clotting and prevent bleeding during and post-surgery. Also, since they can bleed easily, they have to avoid aspirin and most anti-inflammatory drugs. The good news is the bruising does lessen as they age!",

Got hooked on the song and the band.\n\nLearned later that the song is about how shortly after their first album, the lead singer was dating a fan and they were having a baby together. She overdosed killing both herself and the baby. The lead singer felt like he had absolutely nothing left because of that moment, but then a month after their deaths, his dog escaped from his yard and was then hit and killed by a car.\n\nThe song is about him begging for at least his dogs life back because it was all that he had left.\n\nEdit: It would have had to have been 2004.",
