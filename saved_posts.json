And, they get your car cleaner much faster than dragging out your home vacuum to try to clean your car with. \n\n2. Electronics.  Buy them new from brand name shops.  It isn't worth hassling to save $10 somewhere and getting something that doesn't work or doesn't have a reasonable return policy. \n\n3. Household help.  If you can afford it get someone to come in and clean your house on a regular basis.  So it stays...always clean, without you having to do anything. \n\n4. Education.  Now this is a big one and far more could be written about it.  Obviously not all education expense is worthwhile, so I'm not necessarily referring to a college degree or whatnot.

Thought back and had multiple days like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust wasn't interested in it. That was weirdly a big wake up call for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** This blew up way more than I thought it would, so I thought I would clarify since this is getting a lot of exposure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot listening to music is in NO way a sure-fire diagnosis for depression. Even in my most mentally-healthy phases, there is definitely times when I drive/cook/hang out in silence at times. That's normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat isn't normal is that I've been listening to music since I was really young, and really got into it when I was like 9-10. Music is probably my main hobby. In a job where I'm on the road for anywhere from 30 mins to 6 hours a day, I listen to music all the time when I'm not on the phone for work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day, I had been driving for several hours, and just felt... numb. I had a realization that no music was playing- this got me thinking about how long this had been going on, and I realized I had been driving like this for a few weeks now. I also love to cook and listen to music- I'll sing along, make up lyrics, sing to my son, and generally have fun. I had stopped doing this as well. I was already growing concerned about depression, so I discussed this with my psychologist/therapist and PCP. They both agreed, after several discussions, that I am clinically depressed and that not having interest in things you once loved is definitely a sign of depression. So it was one of the first real \"wake-up\" calls for me.",

He's an oncologist. He's not dumb. He can keep up with the subtitles and the subject matter. He just does so much reading for work (he goes through medical journals like crazy) he wants to relax with something silly and mindless, that requires zero effort on his part. He feels the same way about tearjerkers (another of my mom's favorites) where people die slowly from some awful disease. He gets enough of that shit at work. But he'll occasionally sit through them for my mom. We just watched the old Julia Roberts film, Dying Young (where she nurses/falls in love with a young guy dying of cancer) and for half the film he was just looking at my mom with an expression that clearly read \"why the fuck would you do this to me?\"",

Originally it was a mental health drug of some sort, but they realised during drug trials that all the test subjects stopped smoking... So hey, big pharma doing profity type things... Quit smoking drug.\n\nOne of the side effects was \"vivid dreams\", sounds great, bring it on! After about 2 weeks I woke up in sweats because I thought I was being eaten by a giant spider. Ok, fine, that's awesome, how vivid was that?!? But 20ft spiders don't exist, so we're cool.\n\nThe next week I ordered a wash mit for my car. Yeah, boring. I had a dream it had been delivered and spent 8 god damn hours searching my 1 bed flat for this thing. I only stopped when the delivery actually happened and I realised I dreamt the first delivery. Jesus... But ok, I'm not smoking I guess.\n\nA week later I ask one of my employees how a bit of work is coming along... Apparently I hadn't even asked him to do it, apparently I dreamt it. That could be him taking advantage though to be fair. :p\n\nI stopped taking it at that point, I was seriously losing my mind. In America I think they nicknamed it the suicide drug...

The very first time I personally started to have questions was when he proposed an underground hyperloop for Rt 1 in Delaware.  Most people have probably forgotten that but I'm from Delaware and have driven on Rt 1 many times over my entire life, so it caught our attention here. Rt 1 gets a crazy traffic in the summer when people are trying to get from points north to the beach resort towns, but is otherwise a pretty empty stretch of highway connecting not much to not much. Delaware is also basically a sandbar and you only have to dig about 2 feet to hit water (that's an exaggeration in some parts, but not by a lot)... you don't even want your house to have a basement, much less a tunnel running the length of the entire state. So my first reaction was \"wow that would be awesome on July 4 weekend!\" and then \"...but why?\" and then \"but how?\" and then \"wait is there a chance this guy actually a complete loon and nobody has caught on yet?\"",

And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money.

You should always see a doctor if you have any of the symptoms. It's easy to treat if found early but most people don't see the doctor until symptoms have progressed.\n\nI know the American healthcare system sucks. But I got a Colonoscopy (that I had to pay out of pocket since I had no family history and was under the recommended age.) I had 8 polyps, 6 were precancerous. I was 37.\n\nEat your fiber, folks! It's insanely easy to add into your diet and is extremely beneficial to your health. \n\nAnd exercise! You don't have to do anything crazy just get up and intentionally move!\n\nETA: I didn't provide symptoms so people could Google and do their own search (but people are left replies with the symptoms!) My symptoms were literally blood when I wiped that would get better and worse. I also ended up with a fissure (worse than a colonoscopy). I wrote it off as hemorrhoids before finally bringing it up with a Doctor. I did have hemorrhoids and I did have an anal fissure which I don't think were related to the polyps. \n\nETA2: if you have any of the symptoms and your doctor is like \"you're probably fine\" ask for a referral (if you need one) to a GI doctor.  \n\nAlso I am happy to answer any questions. Poop talk is pretty stigmatized and I think there's a lot of embarrassment around it. I also don't want anyone to panic but knowledge is power.",

Since the cop ran after the guy driving, the rest of us took off running too in the opposite direction. \n\nWell we ran towards this unfinished apartment complex that was being built.

Well I asked the officer for a ride home since Uber didn\u2019t exist yet in this small North Dakota town - was also winter. On the ride home, I realize I\u2019m out of cigarettes. So I asked the cop to pull into the gas station real quick near my house so that I could gets eggs and milk for the morning. He kind of looks at me like \u201cWTF?\u201d\u2026 but pulls in.

I was walking to my car and told him it was pretty hot out and I was heading to taco bell. Asked him if he wanted me to grab him a drink or something while I was there. He said no, he was good. So I hopped in my car and started to pull out of the parking lot. I noticed the officer started pulling out of his spot. I started driving to taco bell down the road, and sure enough, the officer was following me. I pulled into the taco bell parking lot and parked. The officer pulled up his car behind mine blocking me in. He started asking all sorts of questions about my personal life, where do I work, and so on. He eventually just said, \"What you just did was SUPER suspicious.\" I asked how being nice to someone is suspicious, and he just put it into drive and drove off. I started walking into taco bell and noticed he discretely pulled into a parking lot across the street. I know the taco bell peeps pretty well, so I went in there for an entire hour just chillin, eating, and generally socializing. Afterwards, I left, started driving to a gas station, and the officer pulled out of the parking lot and started following me along with TWO other police cars. Suddenly I had 3 police cars just following me all over town for the next 15 minutes. They eventually pulled away and that was it. \n\nSo I guess being nice to police officers is considered extremely suspicious. :/",

He was being asked about the reason he pulled them over for the traffic stop that led to the cops finding the drugs and the gun.\n\nIf I recall correctly, they had expired plates or something like that, but the cop obviously couldn\u2019t see that in the speed trap. So the attorney asked why he pulled onto the road and started following them in the first place. I shit you not, the cop said it was because they were driving exactly the speed limit, and none of the people in the car turned their heads to look at the cop when they drove past. \n\nHe said that was suspicious, because everyone speeds on that road. So they must have been doing something wrong if they weren\u2019t speeding. The expired plates gave him the probable cause, but the suspicion came from them just obeying the law. Since then, I never have driven exactly the speed limit. On the highway, I\u2019m at 8 or 9 mph over the speed limit if I\u2019m trying to make good time. If I\u2019m in no rush, I keep it around 5 or 6 over. If I get a Waze notification that there\u2019s a cop coming up, I\u2019ll drop down to 3 or 4 over. But never the exact speed limit.\n\nThat never sat right with me. Moral of the story is that cops can pretty much pull you over whenever they want.

I was kicked out of emergency departments at different hospitals multiple times, because it was not.\n\nI moved to a new city and was lucky enough to score a decent family doctor who took it seriously. She told me she was rather impressed with the amount of \"referred pain\" I was having and that I should go straight to emergency. I replied that there was not a hope in hell I would subject myself to that kind of humiliation again. No way. \n\nShe sent me for a CAT scan and lo and behold, it WAS my appendix. She referred me to a surgeon, and on the day of my surgery no one in the hospital seemed particularly interested in my condition, I think most of the medical staff thought I was having unnecessary surgery though, curiously, they were MUCH nicer to me afterward. I recall a lot of people standing over me in the recovery room.\n\nThe surgeon called me to come in for a meeting a couple of weeks later, and when I walked into his office he had an odd expression on his face. He told me my appendix was many times the normal size, probably because it had been infected and healed over the years, building up scar tissue. He asked me if I minded if he wrote it up in a medical paper or a textbook (I can't remember exactly which - he taught at the university). I gather at the time \"grumbling appendixes\" were a bit of a unicorn and there had been much debate over whether they were real. So I guess my appendix settled that argument in the medical community once and for all.",

Just because you have twitches often doesn't mean you have a problem, especially if you don't have any other reason to believe you have multiple sclerosis or any other disease.

This attitude infects product design even in fields where lifespans are decades and replacement costs are high as we add compute to everything (which can be a great thing).\n\nUSB was successful not because it had one (ish) plug, but because it standardized the protocols devices used.

I stayed in contact with my mother but  my father got full custody, as mom apparently relinquished custody because of her financial situation and claimed she made the difficult decision of giving custody to my dad for the sake of us kids, because he could provide a better life for us. \"The most difficult sacrifice she ever made\". On several occasions my mother would also get drunk and lament her life and say something to the effect of, \"I never should've left your father. He was a good guy, he didn't deserve that. We would've been happy.\"\n\nI had heard variations on it a bunch of times, so one day I decided to share it with my dad. I was in my mid-20s at that point. My dad, who at no point in my life *ever* discussed the divorce or my mom, replied,\n\n\"She said that?\"\n\nYeah.\n\n\"I left her because of her alcoholism and drug use and how she was always drunk during the pregnancy and while you were little. Kids deserve a safe home to grow up in.\"\n\n\nI later got that verified from my maternal grandmother. Apparently everyone knew but never bothered to tell me that my dad was the one who left mom because she was a druggie and an alcoholic, and she didn't have to \"make the difficult sacrifice of giving dad custody because he could provide a better life for us\", the court straight up gave dad custody after a court battle where my mom was deemed unfit to be a parent because of said substance abuses.\n\n\nFor about 20 years, I'd thought my dad got dumped by my mom but turns out, he was just a really good parent and made the right choice for us kids.",

I\u2019m just trying to explain what factors led to the situation.\n\nI had just started a new job and after a few months, ended up completely falling for my married boss. I knew it was wrong and tried to keep my distance but we had a bunch of business trips together which resulted in a lot of 1:1 time. Mentally, I was in a really dark place. I had a string of dates that didn\u2019t go anywhere where I felt rejected and used, gained 40lbs, and my self esteem plummeted. Meanwhile I had this super attractive, successful guy at work lifting me up, telling me I\u2019m smart, beautiful, and that any guy who isn\u2019t into me is an idiot. Anytime I was with him I would finally feel alive again and felt like we just had magnetic chemistry. He also admitted to feeling the same way towards me.\n\nWe tried not to do anything but after a year of tension we finally ended up hooking up. I knew he was married, I knew it was wrong. I never met the wife but thought she must be a much better person than I was. My colleagues had met her and I knew she was beautiful, fit, and seemed really kind. I was at such a low point in my life that I would take the scraps just to be with him.  It was a tumultuous relationship and I tried to end it many times but because we literally worked together in a tiny office and I still had intense feelings for him, it would start back up. I tried dating other people to take my mind off things but couldn\u2019t because I was so in love with him. I felt trapped and would frequently cry in the office bathroom, knowing I needed to get out somehow.\n\nI ended up breaking it off with him, resigning and taking a $70K pay cut just to get myself out of the situation ASAP. Then COVID hit and the new company scaled back their operations and because I was a new employee I was laid off. I then spent the next year in a super deep depression but eventually managed to get myself out of it. \n\nSo I honestly didn\u2019t set out to have a relationship with a married man, I just kind of fell into it over time and made a series of poor decisions. The wife ended up finding out after I had already resigned and I know she is the main victim here and I feel terrible that I hurt someone innocent. \n\nI have since landed back on my feet, gotten a new job, lost all the weight I gained, and am feeling far more confident in myself. Obviously I stay far away from married men and if the situation had happened now instead of at such a low point in my life, I would like to think I would make better decisions. I guess I\u2019m writing all this in response to the comments stating that these women are always \u201cheartless bitches who want to win over a married man\u201d. I mean sure, that can be the case, but there are also situations which are far more nuanced.",

First route of the day, he gets on the radio and starts back complaining. Dispatch asks him a few simple questions, he responds with hostility and some really unprofessional comments. The director of transportation (our big boss) gets on the radio and asks Ed to meet him in his office after morning routes. Ed responds, \"I'll be there if I have time\" boss says, \"I need you to understand, this is not optional\" Ed comes back, \"I need YOU to understand, I'll be there if I have time!\" Mind you, this is on the radio as we are picking up high school kids, everyone can hear what's happening this entire time. Another dispatcher calls in and tells Ed \"when you finish your high school route, park your bus there at the school. We are bringing someone to take your route over, and to bring you back to the lot\". Ed did not like this and responded by saying, \"Negative. I am finishing my route. Me.

Apparently the police were waiting for him once he got there and they removed him from his bus. To quote one driver \"he acted a fool the entire time\". I'm not sure exactly what he was charged with, maybe kidnapping since he acted like he wasn't gonna bring the kids to school unless he got what he wanted? Theft for not bringing the bus back? No clue. But I do know he was arrested and fired. A few days later we get the news that he had a heart attack and died. Most likely from all the stress.",

Well liked, made great money, loved his job, owned a nice house in a beautiful neighbourhood, in a port town we all loved. Married to a wonderful woman (my mom), had two kids. He just couldn\u2019t stop drinking. He became abusive and horrible. Lost everything. His house, his job, his family. He drank himself to death when I was 19, and my sister was 17. He died alone. \n\n\nTo her enormous credit: after she left, my mom put herself through school and supported us all on her own. She got blacklisted by my dad\u2019s family and hers since the divorce was something they all looked down upon, and felt she shouldn\u2019t \u201cshame the family\u201d. They even threatened to gang up on her and lie in court saying she was on drugs. She was not. It was the bravest, and best thing she ever could\u2019ve done for us. At the funeral all these same people just kept telling her how \u201cbrave\u201d she was, and \u201cwe didn\u2019t know how bad he was til years later\u201d.\n\n\nMy sister and I are both successful, thriving adults with great professions. We have our own families and children, we both own our houses and have a good income. We\u2019re well educated. Our lives are filled with love. It\u2019s all thanks to my mom. \n\n\nOver the years I think about my dad from time to time. Having my own children now, a husband, all of whom I love dearly - I can\u2019t imagine any scenario I would ever put them through that. I don\u2019t feel sad about it anymore. But it\u2019s just such a waste. His whole life. And for what? Some liquid in a bottle. \n\n\nAddiction is a terrible thing.\n\n\n\nEdit to add: My mom is a rockstar - nice to know the internet thinks so too. The three of us don\u2019t have contact with either side of the family anymore, and haven\u2019t for a long time. We love our little trio that has grown to include in-laws, grandchildren, and lots of friends. Your family is who you make it - don\u2019t waste time on people who dont love you.",

That is not a high bar, but he's still the best one ive seen.\n\nyeah so i woke up with 40 notifications(Im just going to ignore this thread because i don't want to deal with it.)\n\nyes i do stand by i said. Regan was an ass, bush sr was an ass, Clinton was a sex pest, bush jr was a warmonger, obama tried his best, trump was a monster, and a sex pest, and a racist, biden isn't done yet i have no right to judge is presidency as a whole.",

However, when I look at how the democrats under Biden have been able to rally together, pass multiple laws, work behind the scenes with international partners, win state elections\u2026 I wonder if there isn\u2019t some, if not a lot of truth in the commentary that Peter Zeihan has of Obama in that he was largely an Ivory Tower professor who enjoyed debates with his cabinet but didn\u2019t really want to meet with others and didn\u2019t quite understand how to wield the executive branch effectively. Looking at what the democrats under Biden have been able to do with the CHIPs act, the IRA, the infrastructure bill, erasing student debt, winning back state legislatures, coordinate aid for Ukraine, nudge the Saudis and Israelis closer, working the Hungarians and Turks behind the scenes to allow the Swedes and Finns into NATO, putting China on the economic defensive, etc. I can only dream of what Obama could have achieved if he had more experience in govt. \n\nIn summary: still love Obama the person but I wish he had more experience going into the presidency and could work the US govt to get more of his goals achieved.",
