So worth it to spend $1.50 or whatever to use one rather than trying to use your own vacuum cleaner.  And, they get your car cleaner much faster than dragging out your home vacuum to try to clean your car with. \n\n2. Electronics.  Buy them new from brand name shops.  It isn't worth hassling to save $10 somewhere and getting something that doesn't work or doesn't have a reasonable return policy. \n\n3. Household help.  If you can afford it get someone to come in and clean your house on a regular basis.  So it stays...always clean, without you having to do anything. \n\n4. Education.  Now this is a big one and far more could be written about it.  Obviously not all education expense is worthwhile, so I'm not necessarily referring to a college degree or whatnot.  But educating yourself - or especially, educating kids if you have them, can return dividends throughout their life. \n\n  \n'",

Like, I don't have a strong opinion on the idea, but I was sort of turned off by how he had somehow risen above scrutiny at that moment.\n\nThen came the Thai cave rescue incident. I wasn't bothered by him trying to contribute resources to help, even if nobody had asked for it. But the false accusation, calling his critic a \"pedo guy\" IIRC and everything that followed in that story was a big issue.\n\nThen came the Cybertruck. That thing is ridiculous on a practical level, in so many ways.\n\nThen came the actions he took immediately after purchasing Twitter.

I noticed that the type of people that were rallying around him were not the kind of people I like or even agree with. And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money. It just became extremely obvious that he's very thin-skinned and he's the type of person that can never admit he's wrong about anything. Then, of course, he started letting his racism and anti-semitism slip out, but I was way past my turning point by then.",

My whatever should not stop working because you decided to stop spending money on the servers.  This is bad with software but egregious with hardware and unacceptable with household devices (my water heater should never depend on outside servers).\n\nI've been in tech a long time.  While greed and control and access to sellable data drives lots of things, there is also an attitude surviving from the 90s and 00s that the lifespan of anything is a few years.  This attitude infects product design even in fields where lifespans are decades and replacement costs are high as we add compute to everything (which can be a great thing).\n\nUSB was successful not because it had one (ish) plug, but because it standardized the protocols devices used.  All mice speak one protocol, so anything that knows it (hci class) can handle any mouse.  Zwave and ZigBee tried to do this for household stuff, but instead we got vendor proprietary, Internet connected, phone-home, WiFi devices.\n\nRant done.",

I was walking to my car and told him it was pretty hot out and I was heading to taco bell. Asked him if he wanted me to grab him a drink or something while I was there. He said no, he was good. So I hopped in my car and started to pull out of the parking lot. I noticed the officer started pulling out of his spot. I started driving to taco bell down the road, and sure enough, the officer was following me. I pulled into the taco bell parking lot and parked. The officer pulled up his car behind mine blocking me in. He started asking all sorts of questions about my personal life, where do I work, and so on. He eventually just said, \"What you just did was SUPER suspicious.\" I asked how being nice to someone is suspicious, and he just put it into drive and drove off. I started walking into taco bell and noticed he discretely pulled into a parking lot across the street. I know the taco bell peeps pretty well, so I went in there for an entire hour just chillin, eating, and generally socializing. Afterwards, I left, started driving to a gas station, and the officer pulled out of the parking lot and started following me along with TWO other police cars. Suddenly I had 3 police cars just following me all over town for the next 15 minutes. They eventually pulled away and that was it. \n\nSo I guess being nice to police officers is considered extremely suspicious. :/",

Our brother had a good childhood with his adoptive family, but he was always curious about his birth mother so he wrote her a letter. He sure was surprised to also come to meet his dad and two sisters. Crazy thing is he didn\u2019t live too far away and we all look extremely alike. Would have been weird if we\u2019d have bumped into each other otherwise.",

She had worked hard to earn a degree and enter into a career field. She was kind and beautiful. She was cooperative and she was determined. But despite how hard she was trying she would relapse and this was to be the last chance she got with the courts so the stakes were high. We worked so well together. She spent 18 months going to treatment, getting re-employed, getting her own place and having increased visits with her kids. Who were also wonderful. The kids had been staying at her parent\u2019s place while we were working towards progress. We went to court and requested reunification and the judge granted it. We were all so proud of her!! And happy for them as a family. We planned to fully move her kids home with her a week from that very court date. \n\nTwo days before we planned to return her kids to her she drove her car through the front of a Walmart because she had been huffing and was high. She killed a Walmart employee and proceeded to huff herself to death in the electronics isle, where there was keyboard duster spray, while law enforcement was on its way.

First route of the day, he gets on the radio and starts back complaining. Dispatch asks him a few simple questions, he responds with hostility and some really unprofessional comments. The director of transportation (our big boss) gets on the radio and asks Ed to meet him in his office after morning routes. Ed responds, \"I'll be there if I have time\" boss says, \"I need you to understand, this is not optional\" Ed comes back, \"I need YOU to understand, I'll be there if I have time!\" Mind you, this is on the radio as we are picking up high school kids, everyone can hear what's happening this entire time. Another dispatcher calls in and tells Ed \"when you finish your high school route, park your bus there at the school. We are bringing someone to take your route over, and to bring you back to the lot\". Ed did not like this and responded by saying, \"Negative. I am finishing my route. Me. If you want someone to drive my route, you get (our boss's boss) and have her come drive this route. Otherwise, I am finishing my route.\"  Dispatch asked for an ETA to the high school, he responded \"whenever (our boss's boss) is gonna be there. Otherwise, I get there when I get there\". Somewhere around this time he starts talking like, they were targeting him and picking on him and that  \"it ends today\". Again, at this point he has a bus full of high school kids.\n\nNow, I did not see what happened at the high school, but I heard from several other drivers. Apparently the police were waiting for him once he got there and they removed him from his bus. To quote one driver \"he acted a fool the entire time\". I'm not sure exactly what he was charged with, maybe kidnapping since he acted like he wasn't gonna bring the kids to school unless he got what he wanted? Theft for not bringing the bus back? No clue. But I do know he was arrested and fired. A few days later we get the news that he had a heart attack and died. Most likely from all the stress.",

He died alone. \n\n\nTo her enormous credit: after she left, my mom put herself through school and supported us all on her own. She got blacklisted by my dad\u2019s family and hers since the divorce was something they all looked down upon, and felt she shouldn\u2019t \u201cshame the family\u201d. They even threatened to gang up on her and lie in court saying she was on drugs. She was not. It was the bravest, and best thing she ever could\u2019ve done for us. At the funeral all these same people just kept telling her how \u201cbrave\u201d she was, and \u201cwe didn\u2019t know how bad he was til years later\u201d.\n\n\nMy sister and I are both successful, thriving adults with great professions.

Looking at what the democrats under Biden have been able to do with the CHIPs act, the IRA, the infrastructure bill, erasing student debt, winning back state legislatures, coordinate aid for Ukraine, nudge the Saudis and Israelis closer, working the Hungarians and Turks behind the scenes to allow the Swedes and Finns into NATO, putting China on the economic defensive, etc. I can only dream of what Obama could have achieved if he had more experience in govt. \n\nIn summary: still love Obama the person but I wish he had more experience going into the presidency and could work the US govt to get more of his goals achieved.",
