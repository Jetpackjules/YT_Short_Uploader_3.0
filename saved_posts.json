He ran over a 10-yo-kid who was sledding down the hill in the middle of the road and killed him. It was his next-door-neighbor. There was no charge against him, nobody sued him, because it was clear that it was a freak accident. Even the kid's parents told him it was not his fault.

I opened the door to the laundry room and immediately made eye contact with this shaved cut, buff, ROTC looking guy as he finish folding the last of my clothes in front of me into my basket. It was just the two of us in the room and I swear I was lost in those eyes until he asked, \u201care these yours?\u201d and I shyly replied, \u201cYes. Thanks for folding them.\u201d I swiftly grabbed my clothes and walked out so fast.\n\nIt was a small but very kind-hearted gesture.

I wrote it off as hemorrhoids before finally bringing it up with a Doctor. I did have hemorrhoids and I did have an anal fissure which I don't think were related to the polyps. \n\nETA2: if you have any of the symptoms and your doctor is like \"you're probably fine\" ask for a referral (if you need one) to a GI doctor.  \n\nAlso I am happy to answer any questions.

For a month or two beforehand, he had been uncharacteristically animated and had shouted at my mother. I can't recall but I believe by that point he had already been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but wasn't taking his medication. Around midnight, he rolled in one night as I was just starting to fall asleep. I heard him shouting at my mother downstairs and I made my way to my bedroom door. Then I heard my mother scream and I bolted down the stairs. He had her pinned against the back door. He was definitely drunk which was extremely unusual for him.\n\nI threw him off my mother shouted at him to get back upstairs and he started saying a bunch of shitty stuff to me. My mom called his psychiatrist who told her to call the police and ambulance. Before they arrived, my dad came back downstairs and sprinted at my mother again trying to attack her. I threw him to the floor and wrestled him. Eventually the cops got there at which point he had gone back upstairs. When they walked in his bedroom door he was catatonic.\n\nThey took him to the ambulance and rode with him to the hospital. The on call doctor put him on an involuntary hold because he indicated that he would be a danger to himself or others. He ended up spending a month in a psychiatric facility and they got him on the proper medication. He came home and apologized to me and told me that he didn't remember much about what happened other than that he remembered me beating him up and not knowing why. He told me he loved me and thanked me for protecting my mother. He never had another psychotic episode after that but he was never the same again. His health over the past 20 years has deteriorated steadily. He now has type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's, and dementia. He can't speak in full sentences anymore or really respond at all. He's also completely immobile at this point. I don't remember the last time he was really the father that I grew up with.",
