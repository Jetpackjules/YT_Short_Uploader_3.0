Members only gallery viewings, curator talks, talks by archaeologists and various things you could volunteer for. It was like having an \"In\" into the city.  \n\n\nThe Natural History museum had a monthly \"Jazz under the stars\" night with free food, drinks and music under the planetarium.

In a job where I'm on the road for anywhere from 30 mins to 6 hours a day, I listen to music all the time when I'm not on the phone for work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne day, I had been driving for several hours, and just felt... numb. I had a realization that no music was playing- this got me thinking about how long this had been going on, and I realized I had been driving like this for a few weeks now. I also love to cook and listen to music- I'll sing along, make up lyrics, sing to my son, and generally have fun. I had stopped doing this as well. I was already growing concerned about depression, so I discussed this with my psychologist/therapist and PCP. They both agreed, after several discussions, that I am clinically depressed and that not having interest in things you once loved is definitely a sign of depression.

He's an oncologist. He's not dumb. He can keep up with the subtitles and the subject matter. He just does so much reading for work (he goes through medical journals like crazy) he wants to relax with something silly and mindless, that requires zero effort on his part. He feels the same way about tearjerkers (another of my mom's favorites) where people die slowly from some awful disease. He gets enough of that shit at work. But he'll occasionally sit through them for my mom. We just watched the old Julia Roberts film, Dying Young (where she nurses/falls in love with a young guy dying of cancer) and for half the film he was just looking at my mom with an expression that clearly read \"why the fuck would you do this to me?\"",

But I got a Colonoscopy (that I had to pay out of pocket since I had no family history and was under the recommended age.) I had 8 polyps, 6 were precancerous. I was 37.\n\nEat your fiber, folks! It's insanely easy to add into your diet and is extremely beneficial to your health. \n\nAnd exercise! You don't have to do anything crazy just get up and intentionally move!\n\nETA: I didn't provide symptoms so people could Google and do their own search (but people are left replies with the symptoms!) My symptoms were literally blood when I wiped that would get better and worse. I also ended up with a fissure (worse than a colonoscopy). I wrote it off as hemorrhoids before finally bringing it up with a Doctor. I did have hemorrhoids and I did have an anal fissure which I don't think were related to the polyps. \n\nETA2: if you have any of the symptoms and your doctor is like \"you're probably fine\" ask for a referral (if you need one) to a GI doctor.  \n\nAlso I am happy to answer any questions.

He eventually just said, \"What you just did was SUPER suspicious.\" I asked how being nice to someone is suspicious, and he just put it into drive and drove off. I started walking into taco bell and noticed he discretely pulled into a parking lot across the street. I know the taco bell peeps pretty well, so I went in there for an entire hour just chillin, eating, and generally socializing. Afterwards, I left, started driving to a gas station, and the officer pulled out of the parking lot and started following me along with TWO other police cars. Suddenly I had 3 police cars just following me all over town for the next 15 minutes. They eventually pulled away and that was it. \n\nSo I guess being nice to police officers is considered extremely suspicious. :/",

He was being asked about the reason he pulled them over for the traffic stop that led to the cops finding the drugs and the gun.\n\nIf I recall correctly, they had expired plates or something like that, but the cop obviously couldn\u2019t see that in the speed trap. So the attorney asked why he pulled onto the road and started following them in the first place. I shit you not, the cop said it was because they were driving exactly the speed limit, and none of the people in the car turned their heads to look at the cop when they drove past. \n\nHe said that was suspicious, because everyone speeds on that road. So they must have been doing something wrong if they weren\u2019t speeding. The expired plates gave him the probable cause, but the suspicion came from them just obeying the law. Since then, I never have driven exactly the speed limit. On the highway, I\u2019m at 8 or 9 mph over the speed limit if I\u2019m trying to make good time. If I\u2019m in no rush, I keep it around 5 or 6 over. If I get a Waze notification that there\u2019s a cop coming up, I\u2019ll drop down to 3 or 4 over. But never the exact speed limit.\n\nThat never sat right with me. Moral of the story is that cops can pretty much pull you over whenever they want. Even if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong, they can make something up. It\u2019s shitty.",

She told me she was rather impressed with the amount of \"referred pain\" I was having and that I should go straight to emergency. I replied that there was not a hope in hell I would subject myself to that kind of humiliation again. No way. \n\nShe sent me for a CAT scan and lo and behold, it WAS my appendix. She referred me to a surgeon, and on the day of my surgery no one in the hospital seemed particularly interested in my condition, I think most of the medical staff thought I was having unnecessary surgery though, curiously, they were MUCH nicer to me afterward. I recall a lot of people standing over me in the recovery room.\n\nThe surgeon called me to come in for a meeting a couple of weeks later, and when I walked into his office he had an odd expression on his face. He told me my appendix was many times the normal size, probably because it had been infected and healed over the years, building up scar tissue. He asked me if I minded if he wrote it up in a medical paper or a textbook (I can't remember exactly which - he taught at the university). I gather at the time \"grumbling appendixes\" were a bit of a unicorn and there had been much debate over whether they were real.
