[Response, substack: EQ Precursors, not so fast](https://earthquakeinsights.substack.com/p/earthquake-precursors-not-so-fast)\n\n*****\n\nEarthquake warning system up to 2 hours.\n\nPermanent GPS antennas are located all over the world and more densely at fault zones. About a year ago geologists found that if they stacked all historical GPS data proximal to large earthquakes, they saw there is a very small acceleration of the surface about two hours before the actual earthquake.\n\nWe are literally only missing the technology to make even more precise GPS measures, so we can do this in real time on singular regions. It is proven that this is an actual thing that happens and we can literally warn of earthquakes with a significant time span.\n\n> And the land movement is so subtle that only by lumping all the data together did the precursor stand out, Bletery says. \u201cIf you just remove one or two quakes, you still see it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you remove half, it\u2019s hard to see.\u201d\n\nThis is not a solution or has saved any lives, but it is an absolutely staggering discovery that will have an insane focus in the upcoming years.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/warning-signs-detected-hours-ahead-big-earthquakes",

The footprint is smaller,  and unlike nuclear power, you can turn it on and off pretty quickly which is important for filling the gaps in green energy when the sun doesn't shine or the wind stops blowing.  \n\nThe US government [just cleared out almost all the red tape](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/how-new-tech-is-making-geothermal-energy-a-more-versatile-power-source/) for digging geothermal wells on public land too, basically it is now as easy to dig a geothermal well as it is to dig an oil well.\n\n\n\nThey are even looking at using geothermal wells [like batteries](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/07/1069437/this-geothermal-startup-showed-its-wells-can-be-used-like-a-giant-underground-battery/) by pumping water into them and pressurizing them.

So worth it to spend $1.50 or whatever to use one rather than trying to use your own vacuum cleaner.  And, they get your car cleaner much faster than dragging out your home vacuum to try to clean your car with. \n\n2. Electronics.  Buy them new from brand name shops.  It isn't worth hassling to save $10 somewhere and getting something that doesn't work or doesn't have a reasonable return policy. \n\n3. Household help.  If you can afford it get someone to come in and clean your house on a regular basis.  So it stays...always clean, without you having to do anything. \n\n4. Education.  Now this is a big one and far more could be written about it.  Obviously not all education expense is worthwhile, so I'm not necessarily referring to a college degree or whatnot.  But educating yourself - or especially, educating kids if you have them, can return dividends throughout their life. \n\n  \n'",

And Musk kept doubling down, to the point where he bought Twitter and lost all that money.

It has resulted in dishonesty between the two (which is not the kind of guy he really is) and she has grown disgusted by his need for \u201cchildish\u201d hobbies and entertainment. My sister has always been a bit of a fun-hater, but it\u2019s gotten to the point where it makes her, and sometimes the people around her, miserable. \n\nShe lives and works in a small town and pays attention to who is getting free lunch, who is paying with food stamps at checkout, who is driving a car they can\u2019t afford, etc. She has called me and listed the items she\u2019s seen a family buying with food stamps - can\u2019t fathom them buying Doritos and Kool-Aid. \n\nThere is more than one way to be bad with money.",

I also don't want to install an app just to do something that works just fine on a website.\n\nAlso requiring Internet connectivity is crappy design.  I don't want basic functionality depending on your servers being up (and requiring accounts and giving you unknown data).  My whatever should not stop working because you decided to stop spending money on the servers.  This is bad with software but egregious with hardware and unacceptable with household devices (my water heater should never depend on outside servers).\n\nI've been in tech a long time.  While greed and control and access to sellable data drives lots of things, there is also an attitude surviving from the 90s and 00s that the lifespan of anything is a few years.  This attitude infects product design even in fields where lifespans are decades and replacement costs are high as we add compute to everything (which can be a great thing).\n\nUSB was successful not because it had one (ish) plug, but because it standardized the protocols devices used.  All mice speak one protocol, so anything that knows it (hci class) can handle any mouse.

Since Gene worked with a local charity for disabled children, Andy became a role model - and even caught the eyes of the media, with Nike offering a lifetime supply of shoes, and the pair featuring on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\n\nAndy disappeared on October 19th, 1991, and was later found with his head and wings torn off.

It was the third time the courts had been involved with her due to \u201cdrug abuse\u201d. But her drug of choice was huffing. The only huffing case I ever had. She was absolutely a lovely person. She had worked hard to earn a degree and enter into a career field. She was kind and beautiful. She was cooperative and she was determined. But despite how hard she was trying she would relapse and this was to be the last chance she got with the courts so the stakes were high. We worked so well together. She spent 18 months going to treatment, getting re-employed, getting her own place and having increased visits with her kids. Who were also wonderful. The kids had been staying at her parent\u2019s place while we were working towards progress. We went to court and requested reunification and the judge granted it. We were all so proud of her!! And happy for them as a family. We planned to fully move her kids home with her a week from that very court date. \n\nTwo days before we planned to return her kids to her she drove her car through the front of a Walmart because she had been huffing and was high. She killed a Walmart employee and proceeded to huff herself to death in the electronics isle, where there was keyboard duster spray, while law enforcement was on its way. I got the news at 5am that she was dead and had to go tell her children they wouldn\u2019t be going back to their mother. Ever.",

Ed was always complaining about something,  every single day there was some new issue, some problem. He was a bit of a pain. He got into an argument with one of our supervisors over the radio one day and earned himself a 3 day suspension.\n\nHis first morning back from his suspension. First route of the day, he gets on the radio and starts back complaining. Dispatch asks him a few simple questions, he responds with hostility and some really unprofessional comments. The director of transportation (our big boss) gets on the radio and asks Ed to meet him in his office after morning routes. Ed responds, \"I'll be there if I have time\" boss says, \"I need you to understand, this is not optional\" Ed comes back, \"I need YOU to understand, I'll be there if I have time!\" Mind you, this is on the radio as we are picking up high school kids, everyone can hear what's happening this entire time. Another dispatcher calls in and tells Ed \"when you finish your high school route, park your bus there at the school. We are bringing someone to take your route over, and to bring you back to the lot\". Ed did not like this and responded by saying, \"Negative. I am finishing my route. Me. If you want someone to drive my route, you get (our boss's boss) and have her come drive this route. Otherwise, I am finishing my route.\"  Dispatch asked for an ETA to the high school, he responded \"whenever (our boss's boss) is gonna be there. Otherwise, I get there when I get there\". Somewhere around this time he starts talking like, they were targeting him and picking on him and that  \"it ends today\". Again, at this point he has a bus full of high school kids.\n\nNow, I did not see what happened at the high school, but I heard from several other drivers. Apparently the police were waiting for him once he got there and they removed him from his bus. To quote one driver \"he acted a fool the entire time\". I'm not sure exactly what he was charged with, maybe kidnapping since he acted like he wasn't gonna bring the kids to school unless he got what he wanted? Theft for not bringing the bus back? No clue. But I do know he was arrested and fired. A few days later we get the news that he had a heart attack and died. Most likely from all the stress.",
